Multinational group plan Singapore green methanol plant,07 April 2022,By Lauren Moffitt,"A partnership of six firms have signed an agreement to conduct feasibility studies for a minimum 50,000 t/yr green e-methanol pilot plant in Singapore. Thai natural gas transmission firm PTT Exploration and Production (PTTEP), industrial gases company Air Liquide, Singapore electricity generator YTL PowerSeraya, tank terminals logistics provider Oiltanking, marine fuels supplier Kenoil Marine Services and shipping firm Maersk agreed on 6 April to establish the plant, which is southeast Asia's first green e-methanol project. It will be set up once feasibility studies on technical and economic aspects are completed by the end of 2022. The pilot plant aims to produce green methanol for use as a renewable bunker fuel, by converting captured CO2 and green hydrogen produced from renewable electricity.  Singapore serves as an ideal location as it is one of the world's premier maritime bunkering hubs, the companies said. Singapore's Maritime and Port Authority (MPA) said it welcomed the partnership, which aligns with its aim to become a global hub for decarbonisation research and development.  The MPA in March launched a blueprint for decarbonising Singapore's maritime sector, including plans to supply methanol and other low-carbon marine fuels at the port. The authority is also funding a Singapore-based Global Centre for Maritime Decarbonisation for knowledge and data-sharing to accelerate emissions reductions in the sector. Maersk has also formed partnerships with other companies — including Hong Kong-based CIMC Enric and the Chinese Green Technology Bank — to boost global capacity of green methanol, and source at least 730,000 t/yr of the fuel by the end of 2025.","['<p class=""lead"">A partnership of six firms have signed an agreement to conduct feasibility studies for a minimum 50,000 t/yr green e-methanol pilot plant in Singapore.</p>', ""<p>Thai natural gas transmission firm PTT Exploration and Production (PTTEP), industrial gases company Air Liquide, Singapore electricity generator YTL PowerSeraya, tank terminals logistics provider Oiltanking, marine fuels supplier Kenoil Marine Services and shipping firm Maersk agreed on 6 April to establish the plant, which is southeast Asia's first green e-methanol project.

Shifting coal trade boosts Panamax tonne miles,07 April 2022,By Natalia Gregoriou,"Panamax coal freight rates in the first quarter of 2022 were higher year on year as tight coal supply and concern about sanctions against Russian volumes led to changes in trade routes and an increase in tonne-mile demand. In the Pacific, coal trade from eastern Russia to buyers such as Japan and China was disrupted in the aftermath of the start of the conflict in Ukraine, including by moves by various governments to exclude some Russian banks from global financial messenger service Swift. This led to increased demand from further afield, including Indonesia, which entails coal travelling about twice as far to northeast Asia as it would if coming from the Russian far east ports. European buyers also sought to diversify away from Russia amid railing constraints and perceived sanctions-related risks, leading to an increase in very long haul shipments from east Australia to Europe (albeit with most spot fixtures on Capesize ships), as well as more interest in Colombia to Europe trade. Colombian imports into ARA ports rose by 178pc on the year to 656,000t in March. European utilities even enquired about Indonesian coal, although the extent of this continuing depends on whether Indonesia's mining companies have product that fits the specifications needed by European buyers. Indonesian coal sales to Europe accounted for less than 1pc of the country's total exports in 2021. This shift in trade flows helped to support rates in the global Panamax market during the first quarter. Over the quarter as a whole, the Indonesia to south China rate was up by nearly 30pc year on year, despite a lack of trade in January when Indonesia briefly banned coal exports to support supply to local utilities, and continued output constraints linked to heavy rainfall in the key producing region of Kalimantan. This also does not take into account rates having risen to multi-year highs in the first quarter of last year because of strong demand and Chinese port delays. Compared with the first quarters of 2018-20, rates on the route in 2022 were over twice as high. Other freight rates followed suit, with the east Australia to Japan Panamax rate up by over 30pc on the year in the first quarter, and the Puerto Bolivar to Rotterdam Panamax rate up by 24pc. It should be noted that higher bunker fuel costs were also a factor in these increases. Global economies are scurrying to find alternative suppliers owing to the uncertainty around Russian supplies, Hellaschart dry bulk shipbroker Marios Tepenkiozis told Argus. Trade flows in the Panamax and Capesize markets are likely to change further in the near future, which could further support freight rates in the second quarter, Tepenkiozis said. Specific changes in trade flows are difficult to anticipate, he said, but Atlantic Russian coal shipments to Asian markets, as well as Europe paying for longer-haul imports of South African and Australian coal are now more likely in the medium term, which would boost tonne-mile demand for dry bulk ships.","['<p class=""lead"">Panamax coal freight rates in the first quarter of 2022 were higher year on year as tight coal supply and concern about sanctions against Russian volumes led to changes in trade routes and an increase in tonne-mile demand.</p>', '<p>In the Pacific, coal trade from eastern Russia to buyers such as Japan and China was disrupted in the aftermath of the start of the conflict in Ukraine, including by moves by various governments to <a href=""https://direct.argusmedia.com/newsandanalysis/article/2306283"">exclude some Russian banks from global financial messenger service Swift</a>.</p>', '<p>This led to increased demand from further afield, including Indonesia, which entails coal travelling about twice as far to northeast Asia as it would if coming from the Russian far east ports.</p>', '<p>European buyers also sought to <a href=""https://direct.argusmedia.com/newsandanalysis/article/2318962"">diversify away from Russia</a> amid railing constraints and perceived sanctions-related risks, leading to an increase in very long haul shipments from east Australia to Europe (albeit with most spot fixtures on Capesize ships), as well as more interest in Colombia to Europe trade.

Yemen president transfers power to presidential council,07 April 2022,By Nader Itayim,"Yemen's Saudi-backed President Abd Rabbo Mansour Hadi has dismissed his vice president Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar and transferred his own powers to a new council of key political and military figures. The council will assume the duties of the president and vice president during what it has termed a ""transitional period"", according to a presidential decree. It will temporarily oversee Yemen's political, military and security arms. The council will be chaired by Rashad Muhammad al-Alimi, a former deputy prime minister and ally of Hadi, and will have seven other members that all hold the rank of deputy chairmen.  The move comes days into UN-brokered two month truce in Yemen, which includes the Houthi rebels that seized the capital Sana'a and surrounding areas in 2014. Since then a Saudi-led military coalition has been fighting on the Hadi government's behalf, and the conflict had escalated in recent months with the Houthis in particular stepping up their attacks on Saudi Arabia with increased drone and ballistic missile attacks on key energy facilities, many of them operated by state-controlled Aramco. This is the first nationwide truce in Yemen since 2016, which was implemented ahead of peace talks in Kuwait. But that ceasefire was violated almost immediately. A new round of talks, this time led by the Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC), has been taking place in the Saudi capital Riyadh since 30 March. The Houthis rejected an invitation to participate, requesting a neutral venue.  Riyadh welcomed the transfer of power in Yemen. It said it fully supports the presidential leadership council in efforts to implement ""effective policies and initiatives that would realize security and stability"", including around $3bn in financial assistance for the Yemeni economy. Saudi Arabia said $2bn will be offered jointly by Riyadh and Abu Dhabi in support of Yemen's central bank, with an additional $1bn coming from Saudi Arabia, of which $600mn would go towards the purchase of Saudi oil products and $400mn towards supporting development projects and initiatives.  Riyadh called for an international donors' conference to be held and pledged a further $300mn for humanitarian assistance.  It urged the presidential council to ""embark on negotiations"" with the Houthis in order to reach a ""final and comprehensive political solution.""","['<p class=""lead"">Yemen\'s Saudi-backed President Abd Rabbo Mansour Hadi has dismissed his vice president Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar and transferred his own powers to a new council of key political and military figures.</p>', '<p>The council will assume the duties of the president and vice president during what it has termed a ""transitional period"", according to a presidential decree.

Australia plans to slow power plant closures,07 April 2022,By Kevin Morrison,"The Australian federal government plans to slow down the accelerated rate of power plant closures, which are mainly ageing coal-fired power plants, with proposals requiring utilities to provide a five-year notice before closing a plant compared with the current 3½ years. The changes are to ensure that the energy sector has enough time to build new power generation capacity to replace the planned exiting capacity, with the lead time required to build most forms of new generation capacity far exceeding the current 3½-year notice period, Australian energy minister Angus Taylor said. The government has requested the Australian Energy Market Commission to make changes to the National Electricity Rules, he said. The proposed changes come as several utilities operating in Australia have brought forward the closure dates of their respective coal-fired plants, most of which are near the end of their technical life and are facing increasing competition from solar power generation during daylight hours and in turn reduce spot power prices and cause operating losses for the coal-fired power plants.  The proposed new rule also includes a new definition of ‘longer term mothballing', within notice of closure arrangements, Taylor said. A longer term mothballed plant will be defined as a generator that will be unable able to dispatch electricity for nine months or longer over a 12-month period. These generators will be subject to the same notice period that applies to permanent closures, to avoid potential gaming where generators could mothball a plant indefinitely without providing any notice or date of an intended closure, Taylor said. Under the proposed rule, the Australian Energy Regulator would investigate any notice that it suspects to be speculative. In 2019 the government also set up a [task force to look into options to deal with the planned closure of the 1,680MW Liddell coal-fired power plant in New South Wales by April 2023, including a further extension to its lifespan or replacing it with a new coal-fired power plant.  Taylor has also had a plan where idle coal-fired power plants would be paid in case they are required during peak periods if demand surges or supplies from existing power generation plants are disrupted. This plan was opposed by the majority of Australia's state and territory governments. The rule changes come ahead of an expected federal election to be held before the end of May.

Mexico works on plan to add coker to Salina Cruz,06 April 2022,By Sergio Meana,"Mexico's government is readying a plan to add a coker to the 330,000 b/d Salina Cruz refinery in Oaxaca state on the west coast to help boost production of higher-value refined products. The addition would support President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's goal of making Mexico self-sufficient in refined products. Revenue from higher prices for Mexico's crude exports would pay for the expansion, as Mexico has held back on its plan to cut crude exports entirely by 2023, the president said. The government provided no detail on costs, but a long-delayed plan to add a coker at the 315,000 b/d Tula refinery — now by the end of 2023 — has a budget of $3bn. Unnamed companies working on Mexico's new 340,000 b/d Olmeca refinery in Dos Bocas, Tabasco, have already expressed interest in the Salina Cruz coker project to Mexico's energy ministry (Sener), one source told Argus. Construction firms Samsung, ICA Fluor and Technip are the main construction companies working in the Olmeca refinery, after US construction firm KBR left the project in the early stages because of soaring costs. The viability of the Salina Cruz coker project also depends on how long it will take to build as the president wants to leave no unfinished projects when he leaves office in December 2024. Of state-owned Pemex's six domestic refineries, only three — the 285,000 b/d Minatitlan, 275,000 b/d Cadereyta, and 190,000 b/d Madero — have coker units that convert residual fuel oil into higher value distillates such as gasoline and diesel. The Tula coker would also process fuel oil from the neighboring 285,000 b/d Salamanca refinery. With $8bn earmarked for the Olmeca refinery — and other budget estimates closer to $12bn — $3bn for the Tula coker and $3bn for the Salina Cruz coker, and $1.5bn in combined debt and direct cash payments to purchase the 340,000 b/d Deer Park refinery in Texas, Mexico's government would invest $15.5bn in refineries during the Lopez Obrador administration.","['<p class=""lead"">Mexico\'s government is readying a plan to add a coker to the 330,000 b/d Salina Cruz refinery in Oaxaca state on the west coast to help boost production of higher-value refined products.</p>', ""<p>The addition would support President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's goal of making Mexico self-sufficient in refined products.</p>"", ""<p>Revenue from higher prices for Mexico's crude exports would pay for the expansion, as Mexico has held back on its plan to cut crude exports entirely by 2023, the president said.

"New Petrobras CEO, chairman confirmed: Update",14 April 2022,By Nathan Walters ,"Updates with comments from Coelho. Shareholders of Brazilian oil company Petrobras have approved the appointment of Jose Mauro Ferreira Coelho as the new chief executive and Marcio Andrade Weber as the new chairman, ending weeks of tension surrounding leadership at the state-controlled company. On 6 April, Ferreira Coelho was nominated by the federal government, Petrobras' controlling shareholder, just days after an initial pick, Adriano Pires, withdrew from consideration. Andrade Weber was also a replacement nominee, picked after oil industry veteran Rodolfo Landim bowed out of consideration for the chairman role.  Ferreira Coelho, a former mines and energy ministry secretary, formally assumed the position at a swearing-in ceremony Petrobras' Rio de Janeiro headquarters this afternoon. His nomination was approved at a 13 April shareholder meeting almost exactly one year after the outgoing chief executive Joaquim Silva e Luna was voted into the role.  Ferreira Coelho said today during the ceremony ""... practicing market prices is a necessary condition to create a competitive business environment, to attract investments, new agents to the market, expand infrastructure, and guarantee domestic supply,"" a signal of his commitment to market-based fuel pricing — an issue that prematurely ended the tenure of multiple successors.  He also spoke of creating conditions to further Petrobras' refinery divestment program. Market-based pricing is seen as key to attracting investors to the 1mn b/d of refining capacity the firm is selling. And he talked of improving communication with the public and lawmakers, an effort that has faltered in the past.  Ferreira Coelho reiterated the company's commitment to upstream development in the Campos basin — once the country's most important offshore regions and a politically-relevant regional job creator — and pursuing exploration opportunities in the Equatorial Margin and the Sergipe-Alagoas basin.  Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro fired Silva e Luna last month following an 11 March fuel price increase that incensed the country's political class. He was the second Petrobras chief executive to be fired by the populist Bolsonaro because of disagreements over fuel pricing. The market is more confident that Ferreira Coelho and Andrade Weber will keep the company wed to the import price parity principle that guides its fuel pricing policy, which strives for alignment with import prices. The company's stock has climbed steadily on the Sao Paulo stock exchange ever since news of the nominations. If Bolsonaro fails to secure a second four-year term in October elections, the executives are not likely be asked to remain in the roles by the incoming president, based on the current election landscape.","['<p><i>Updates with comments from Coelho.</i></p>', '<p class=""lead"">Shareholders of Brazilian oil company Petrobras have approved the appointment of Jose Mauro Ferreira Coelho as the new chief executive and Marcio Andrade Weber as the new chairman, ending weeks of tension surrounding leadership at the state-controlled company.</p>', ""<p>On 6 April, Ferreira Coelho was nominated by the federal government, Petrobras' controlling shareholder, just days after an initial pick, Adriano Pires, withdrew from consideration.

Brasil eleva estimativa para safra 2021-22,07 April 2022,Por João Petrini,"A Companhia Nacional de Abastecimento (Conab) voltou a elevar a previsão para a safra 2021-22 de grãos e oleaginosas, após três meses consecutivos de cortes. Com chuvas mais regulares, o plantio do milho segunda safra aconteceu em boas condições de umidade do solo, o que contribuiu para um aumento da produção esperada. A Conab aponta que as perspectivas são positivas, já que no final de março as lavouras mostravam bons sinais de desenvolvimento e condições de plantio. No entanto, o resultado final ainda depende do clima, que tem sido instável nos últimos anos. A produção total da safra 2021-22 de grãos e oleaginosas deve agora atingir 269,3 milhões de t, acima dos 265,7 milhões de t estimados em março, de acordo com a sétima pesquisa da Conab. O volume é 5,4pc maior que a temporada 2020-21 e, se confirmado, será um recorde, superando os 258 milhões de t atingidos em 2019-20. Em comparação com a primeira estimativa para a safra atual, divulgada em outubro de 2021, a estimativa de abril é 6,7pc menor. Houve uma redução de 19,3 milhões de t, dos 288,6 milhões de t inicialmente esperados. As condições climáticas adversas nos estados da região Sul e na parte centro-sul do Mato Grosso do Sul causaram maiores perdas em soja e milho. Para a safra 2021-22, a área plantada estimada é de 72,8 milhões de hectares (ha), maior do que a estimativa de março de 72,7 milhões de ha. A Conab reduziu ligeiramente sua estimativa para a produção de soja, agora fixada em 122,4 milhões de t. A nova estimativa é 0,3pc abaixo da projeção de março de 122,8 milhões de t e 11,4pc abaixo da safra anterior, que foi de 138,2 milhões de t. A área esperada é de 40,8 milhões de ha, ligeiramente acima dos 40,7 milhões de ha do mês passado e 4,1pc acima da safra anterior. A Conab espera uma produção total de milho – considerando a primeira, segunda e terceira safras - de 115,6 milhões de t, volume que fica 32,7pc acima da safra 2020-21 e 2,9pc maior em relação às perspectivas de março. A área total estimada para o milho é de 21,2 milhões de ha, acima dos 21,1 milhões de ha registrados em março e alta de 6,5pc em relação à temporada anterior. Para a primeira safra de milho, a produção esperada é de 24,9 milhões de t, 2,3pc acima da estimativa de março de 24,3 milhões de t, e crescimento de 0,6pc em relação à safra 2020-21. A segunda safra, a maior do país, está prevista em 88,5 milhões de t, acima da estimativa de março de 86,1 milhões de t, e alta de 45,8pc em relação à safra anterior. Espera-se que a produção de algodão em pluma atinja 2,8 milhões de t, estável em relação à estimativa anterior e crescimento de 19,9pc na comparação com o ano passado. Para o trigo, a Conab publicou sua terceira estimativa para a safra 2022-23e prevê uma produção de 7,9 milhões de t, estável em relação à estimativa anterior e 3pc maior que a safra anterior, que foi de 7,7mn t. O consumo doméstico de soja no Brasil para a temporada 2021-22 está estimado em 49,9 milhões de t, acima dos 46,4 milhões de t em março, mas abaixo dos 50,9 milhões de t da última temporada. Espera-se que as exportações de soja atinjam 77 milhões de t, abaixo dos 80,2 milhões de t previstos em março e abaixo dos 86,1 milhões de t alcançados um ano antes. As importações estão projetadas em 900.000t. O consumo doméstico de milho é esperado em 77,1 milhões de t, acima dos 76,5 milhões de t previstos em março e acima dos 72,2 milhões de t de um ano antes. As exportações de milho devem chegar a 37 milhões de t, acima das previsões anteriores de 35 milhões de t.

Low EU HRC quota utilisation testimony to weak demand,07 April 2022,By Colin Richardson,"The low utilisation of hot-rolled coil (HRC) quotas so far this quarter is testimony to low demand for imported tonnes at the start of this year. Out of available quotas of about 2.28mn t for HRC under the resetting EU safeguard for April-June, more than 2mnt still remain, suggesting utilisation of just 12pc. All of the main overseas sellers into the EU have substantial tonnages left to be utilised, despite main ports still holding significant tonnages of coils. The market was in destocking mode towards the end of last year and at the start of this year, in anticipation of further price declines. Argus' headline Italian index hit a peak of €1,130.75/t on 2 June last year, before falling over the rest of that year to €818.25/t on 11 January 2022. Argus' northwest EU HRC index reached a then-record high of €1,206.50/t on 22 June, before also slipping over the rest of that year, reaching €904.50/t on 11 January of this year. Interest in imported tonnages, as a result, was low in the fourth quarter. Imports were also more expensive than they are now compared with domestic coils. Low automotive demand also meant service centre stocks were high, particularly in the heavily auto-exposed German market; the country's distributors had 3.9 months of stock based on sales in December, according to data from association BDS. Demand for imports has increased since then, aided by the rapid jump in domestic prices amid supply disruptions last month. The discount for cfr Italian HRC compared with domestic prices reached an unsustainable level of €174/t on 24 March. At such levels, it was always likely that buyers would turn away from domestic supply and towards overseas tonnages. These imports, likely to arrive in June and be cleared into July quotas, are now tempering demand, alongside the huge discount for Chinese material. Chinese HRC recently has been offered into both Italy and Antwerp at about €1,100/t cfr, including duties, more than €200/t below domestic NWE prices.","['<p class=""lead"">The low utilisation of hot-rolled coil (HRC) quotas so far this quarter is testimony to low demand for imported tonnes at the start of this year.</p>', '<p>Out of available quotas of about 2.28mn t for HRC under the resetting EU safeguard for April-June, more than 2mnt still remain, suggesting utilisation of just 12pc.</p>', '<p>All of the main overseas sellers into the EU have substantial tonnages left to be utilised, despite main ports still holding significant tonnages of coils.</p>', ""<p>The market was in destocking mode towards the end of last year and at the start of this year, in anticipation of further price declines. <i>Argus</i>' headline Italian index hit a peak of €1,130.75/t on 2 June last year, before falling over the rest of that year to €818.25/t on 11 January 2022. <i>Argus</i>' northwest EU HRC index reached a then-record high of €1,206.50/t on 22 June, before also slipping over the rest of that year, reaching €904.50/t on 11 January of this year.</p>"", ""<p>Interest in imported tonnages, as a result, was low in the fourth quarter.

Brazil’s Alagoas state to attract industry with gas,07 April 2022,By Flávia Pierry,"The new Brazilian gas market and state-run Petrobras' divestment process are helping the state of Alagoas in its strategy to increase oil and gas production and lure industries interested in less-expensive gas. Alagoas also seeks to expand its gas distribution grid, aiming for residential gas consumption to displace LPG service in vessels, Alagoas economy secretary George Santoro told Argus. This would help local distribution company Algas maintain revenue as large industrial gas consumers shift to bilateral gas supply agreements.  Alagoas is updating state laws to address the gas distribution business under the open markets, which Santoro expects to be fully approved by June. The state is also empowering its local regulatory agency to better deal with gas issues, which includes hiring more workers.  There are other challenges the Brazilian gas market changes bring for the states Santoro said, including the high transportation tariffs for Northeastern states and the need for a tool to measure gas movement volumes from one state to another, which will be key for collecting state taxes.  Alagoas, located in the northeastern coastal region, was one of the first states in Brazil with active oil production in the 1970's but it saw a decrease in investments after Petrobras drove its focus to offshore and pre-salt areas in other states. Now, the new gas market and Petrobras' divestment program has set the stage for more oil and gas investments, including gas production by integrated producer Origem Energia and attracted ExxonMobil to start oil and gas exploration. ""Prior to oil and gas investment returning to Alagoas, our port of Maceió was mainly used for sugar exports and petchem imports,"" Santoro said. ""And now we are seeing ExxonMobil installing infrastructure to start exploration this year."" He lauded the new tax revenue coming from the restarted Origem gas production, and the prospects of revenue from ExxonMobil's exploration projects, which may take up to five years to start commercially. ""Alagoas used to be a gas exporter to other states,"" he said. ""When Petrobras decreased gas production here, we had to start importing to serve existing petrochemical companies. But now, with the Origem production, Alagoas is self-sufficient in gas, in just two months of production.""  In five years, Alagoas projects 3mn m³/d in production from its onshore gas fields, bringing it back to its 1970s production levels. Santoro believes the region will soon build a new gas processing facility to add capacity to the Pilar unit since it will not be able to handle the growing production.  With more gas, the state is also welcoming gas-fired thermal generation. Seven new power plants have already received environmental permits to participate at the November federal power auction, which may add around 800MW of thermal capacity to the Brazilian interconnected grid.  ""Our state does not have wind and solar power, so natural gas is our bet for the energy transition,"" said Santoro.  Alagoas is also expanding its biomethane and biogas production. The state has one biomethane production plant at a landfill that is used to generate power onsite, and is studying other possibilities of biogas generation at 13 sugarcane mills.

CSU predicts above-normal Atlantic hurricane activity,07 April 2022,By Nola Z Valente,"The 2022 Atlantic hurricane season could be more active than usual as sea temperatures across the tropical Atlantic are higher than normal, Colorado State University (CSU) said in its annual outlook today.  Another factor for the above-average prediction is the absence of El Niño, according to CSU researchers. The six-month long hurricane season should have 19 named storms, nine of which could become hurricanes and four that could turn into major hurricanes of Category 3 or higher, according to the outlook. This would be the seventh consecutive above-average Atlantic hurricane season. The average for tropical cyclones in the Atlantic between 1991 and 2020 is seven hurricanes, three of them major, and 14 tropical storms, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.  The 2022 hurricane activity should be about 130pc above the average season from 1991 to 2020, compared with 2021's hurricane season that was up by 120pc. Hurricanes have had less impact on energy markets over the years because a greater share of US output comes from onshore. Storms can disrupt operations at power plants, limiting demand for crude and natural gas, and potentially leading to higher prices for gasoline and other refined products.  The Atlantic hurricane season begins 1 June and ends on 30 November, but storms can form outside of that time.  The CSU Tropical Meterology Project is based on about 40 years of data.

US regulator plans hearing on rail services woes,07 April 2022,By Abby Caplan,"US rail regulators will hold a hearing on 26-27 April to investigate reports of urgent, ""inconsistent and unreliable rail service."" The US Surface Transportation Board (STB) said today its public hearing will focus on recent rail service problems as well as recovery efforts involving several Class I railroads. ""The board expects the railroads to explain the actions they will take to fix these issues,"" STB chairman Martin Oberman said. STB has heard informally in recent weeks from a broad range of stakeholders about deteriorating and uneven rail service, including trade organizations and major shippers, particularly those representing agriculture and energy interests. US agriculture secretary Thomas Vilsack reached out last week, asking STB to help resolve service issues. Service issues also came up frequently during last month's public hearing on reciprocal switching. The ""serious nature of the service issues reported"" will help guide any actions taken to resolve difficulties, STB said. The agency plans to provide as much visibility as possible to these issues. Since joining STB, Oberman has commented frequently about the effort ""Class I railroads have placed on lowering their operating ratios and satisfying their shareholders even at the cost of their customers."" Those efforts have included cutting railroads' workforce ""to the bare bones in order to reduce costs,"" he said. ""In my view, all of this has directly contributed to where we are today — rail users experiencing serious deterioration in rail service because, on too many parts of their networks, the railroads simply do not have a sufficient number of employees,"" Oberman said today.

Exxon-led consortium comes up dry offshore Brazil,28 March 2022,By Nathan Walters,"A wildcat well drilled by an ExxonMobil-led consortium in Brazil's deepwater Sergipe-Alagoas basin did not result in the discovery of oil, the latest in a closely watched exploration campaign in one of the country's most promising frontier basins.  Brazilian independent Enauta, a partner in the SEAL-M-428 block, said the consortium will add sampled data from the Cutthroat prospect into regional geologic interpretation, ""and update its vision as to the exploratory potential of the blocks located in the Sergipe-Alagoas Basin ultradeep waters."" The well is the only drilling the consortium has planned for the block this year, Enauta executives said earlier this month.  ExxonMobil holds a 50pc working interest in SEAL-M-428 and eight other Sergipe-Alagoas blocks in partnership with Enauta and US independent Murphy Oil, which hold 30pc and 20pc, respectively, in each of the nine.

Paraguay finalizes fuel subsidy bill,28 March 2022,By Lucien Chauvin ,"Paraguay will subsidize gasoline prices at service stations run by the state-run oil company, Petropar, for at least the next two months. The legislation, signed by president Mario Abdo on 25 March, allows Petropar to keep pump prices in check, with the government paying for the difference as international crude prices increase. The subsidy will be in place for at least two months, but can be extended.  The government claims the measure will cost around $20mn monthly, but critics argue that the price tag will be much higher and distort the market, with Paraguayans turning to Petropar's 228 service stations instead of 1,300 private gas stations in the country when they need to fill up. They also say that the move will ultimately backfire, because Petropar will be unable to meet demand and does not have mechanisms in place to increase imports quickly on the spot market.  The association of private service station owners, Apesa, says the move could force private companies, particularly small chains, to close.  The legislation does not include a government request to add $100mn in new debt to pay for the subsidy.  Landlocked Paraguay does not produce crude. Slightly more than half of Paraguay's fuel is imported from neighboring Argentina, about 20pc comes from the US, and the rest from a basket of countries. Brazil's Raizen is the largest player in the Paraguayan market, with more than 350 stations. It took over the local Barcos &amp; Rodados distributor in 2021.  Paraguay is joining a growing list of countries in the region with programs to alleviate raising fuel prices.  In Peru, the government announced on 23 March that it would increase the subsidy for LPG for low income families by 25pc to offset rising prices. It is considering temporarily adding 84 and 90 octane gasoline to a price stabilization mechanism.

EPA reverses Trump-era SRE decisions,07 April 2022,By Dylan Chase and Thom Dwyer ,"The US Environmental Protection Agency today denied 36 requests from US small refiners seeking waivers from renewable fuel blending mandates for the 2018 compliance year, including 31 petitions that were previously granted under former president Donald Trump.  The EPA said the 31 companies that previously had 2018 small refinery exemption (SRE) requests granted will not have to purchase new renewable fuel blending credits to show compliance for the 2018 year, despite the reversal.  The EPA's decision today follows recent lawsuits that have reshaped the agency's interpretation of SREs, which have historically offered refiners processing less than 75,000 b/d an exemption from renewable fuel blending mandates if they could demonstrate ""disproportionate economic hardship (DEH).""  The Trump-era EPA in 2019 approved 31 of 36 requests for SRE waivers for the 2018 year, but those decisions were successfully challenged by biofuels groups in a 2020 lawsuit on the grounds that the EPA had an overly broad interpretation of DEH. The Supreme Court then handed a win back to refiners last year when it ruled on appeal, leading a DC Circuit court to remand all 2018 SRE decisions back to the EPA so it could interpret the new rulings and come up with a new approach to the waivers. The EPA already signaled a ""changing approach"" to SREs on 7 December of last year, when it proposed to reject all 65 pending applications for SREs for the 2016-2021 compliance years. Its decision to now reverse already-granted decisions from 2018 signals a hardline approach against the waivers, although the agency promised affected refiners will not need to rush to the market to purchase renewable identification number (RIN) blending credits. The thirty-one affected companies would be considered liable for 1.4bn RINs if the agency were to ask them to retroactively show compliance with 2018 blending mandates. But that would imply ""such a large obligation"" that refiners would need to spread those RIN purchases over multiple years in order to not threaten the integrity of the market for the credits, the EPA said.  In lieu of providing the 1.4bn RINs, the small refiners will instead be asked to merely submit new compliance reports and data for 2018, including gasoline and diesel fuel production that would normally require refiners to blend a certain amount of renewable fuel. The agency explained this by saying its decision to deny the SRE requests and its decision to not require additional RINs from affected companies represent ""separate and independent"" decisions each ""severable"" from the other.  RIN credits were bid up on the day as the market anticipated the EPA announcement. Current year ethanol D6 RIN credits traded between 119¢/RIN and 122¢/RIN, rising by 7¢/RIN to 120.5¢/RIN. Biomass-based diesel D4 RINs with 2022 vintage increased by 7.25¢/RIN to 159.25¢/RIN. The Argus RVO rose day on day by 0.86¢/USG to 16.35¢/USG, reaching its highest since 2 March Following the agency's announcement, which occurred at the termination of Argus' trading deadline, RIN credits pulled back sharply. Ethanol D6 credits traded at 116¢/RIN and 115¢/RIN while current year D4 credits exchanged hands at 156¢/RIN. Market participants said that buyer demand pulled back following the announcement. While the EPA's decision was partly intended to stabilize the market for RINs, US refining interests signaled ""deep disappointment"" with the agency's insistence that blending rules enforced under the US Renewable Fuel Standard program do not cause small refiners economic hardship. ""EPA's blanket denial of relief for small refineries is a political decision that contradicts Congress's design for the RFS,"" said Geoff Moody, president of refining trade group AFPM. ""We are deeply disappointed in this and in the precedent it sets for small refineries experiencing hardship and the communities and regions that rely on these facilities for energy security."" US biofuel trade group Growth Energy did not respond to a request for comment.  The EPA's decision to reject 65 pending SRE requests for 2016-2021 is still pending but could be finalized as soon as 3 June, the deadline by which the agency must issue final renewable fuel blending mandates for the 2020 and 2021 compliance years.

Biomethane to fill niche in new Brazil gas market,28 March 2022,By Flávia Pierry,"Brazilian biomethane production is skirting pipeline restrictions and expanding its market, creating a niche for companies aiming to decarbonize.  The sector won an important victory last week when the government announced a plan to increase investment in the biomethane productive chain by lowering taxes and creating methane credits. A source told Argus that the government is studying reducing the PIS/Cofins federal taxes on heavy vehicle purchases, which was not announced in the ""zero methane"" plan.  The federal tax break allowing new biomethane plants to enjoy the special regime set aside for infrastructure can amount to around a 10pc capital spending (capex) reduction, improving the net present value of those projects, as estimated by producers. But producers do not think the tax changes will materially move the needle on investments, although they do at least signal the government's thinking about the industry. ""The federal government showed biomethane is a strategy for the country, not only a green niche product,"" said Marcel Jorand, chief executive at biomethane producer Gás Verde. ""We have this enormous source of renewable energy, and this is magical and strategic."" MDC Energia chief executive Manuela Kayath added that the industry has waited a decade for the government to show support.  ""This brings momentum for the sector,"" Kayath said. ""It is more about the direction given by the government than the actions per se, and we may see more to come for this industry."" The biomethane industry can benefit from a weakness of the natural gas industry: a lack of pipeline capacity in inland states. Participants anticipate biogas to be generated from crops in rural areas and consumed by heavy vehicles in the same regions, which can reduce diesel fueling costs alongside the carbon footprint of Brazil's massive agriculture industry. Kayath anticipates the creation of biomethane generation and consumption clusters off the natural gas grid, with trucked-in compressed natural gas as a potential backup. Because biomethane production is still small in Brazil, with only four plants producing less than 50,000m³/d, producers are aiming at buyers with decarbonization goals that are willing to pay more for the lower-carbon fuel.  This is already happening with some MDC and Gás Verde customers, with the added benefit of not being subject to international crude or gas price fluctuations affecting price indexes.  Biogas producers association ABIOGÁS predicts Brazil's biomethane production will be 2.3mn m³/d by 2030, which is still a relatively small volume for heavy industrial natural gas consumers.  ""Biomethane is great for decarbonization, but it is just window dressing for large consumers,"" said a large gas user.  Gás Verde's Jorand added that biomethane and natural gas ""walk hand in hand, since with more gas reaching the market, we will rebalance the whole demand curve."" The next step for the biomethane industry is the creation of ways to price or define value for the green/environmental attributes of biomethane, that adds to the heating and fueling attibutes. For producers, this can make the difference for the penetration of the fuel into the market on a competitive basis but also as part of the biomethane credits market.  Other important potential assists to the industry would be lower-cost loans for biomethane producers and consumers, and less bureaucracy for permits. The development of a biomethane credit is another issue that needs to be worked on, since the governmental plan did not detail the certificates and credits. Although it is part of the government's plan, participants say it is just an idea so far without any evidence of further action.","['<p class=""lead"">Brazilian biomethane production is skirting pipeline restrictions and expanding its market, creating a niche for companies aiming to decarbonize. </p>', '<p>The sector won an important victory last week when the government announced a <a href=""https://direct.argusmedia.com/newsandanalysis/article/2314736"">plan to increase investment in the biomethane productive chain by lowering taxes and creating methane credits</a>.

Wheat: Buyers pressure prices,28 March 2022,None,"Global wheat prices moved downwards on Monday, as buyers stepped back from purchasing at current levels.  In the Black Sea region, a deal was heard from Friday for 11.5pc protein content European — Bulgarian or Romanian — wheat for April shipment at $405/t fob Constanta/Varna/Burgas. The traded level was significantly below offers heard at $415/t for the product earlier in the week.  Buying interest was heard for European 11.5pc and 12.5pc wheat for shipment in late April-early May, with a bid heard for OAIC specification-compliant Romanian wheat at €8/t below the Euronext May contract, equal to some $398/t. Offers for Bulgarian 11.5pc wheat for April-May loading were heard as low as $405/t fob Constanta/Varna/Burgas on Monday. But Romanian 12pc product was heard offered at $422/t fob Constanta for a handy-size cargo, indicating a wide spread between grades.  In South America, Argentinian spot 11.5pc wheat was heard offered at $372-373/t fob upriver on Monday, some $2-3/t below Friday's levels.  On the global futures markets, wheat curves fell on Monday, posting greater losses towards the beginning of the curve. Chicago SRW wheat May futures were down by ¢49.4/bu on Friday, with milder losses further out along the curve, at the time of writing. Meanwhile, Euronext French milling wheat May futures were down by €13.25/t.  Elsewhere, Jordan announced an international tender for 120,000t of milling wheat for shipment window options throughout May-July, closing on 31 March.  Meanwhile, insuring Black Sea cargoes could become more complicated, with a floating sea mine spotted near Bulgarian shores during the weekend.  China's winter wheat conditions improved in late March and are also up on the year. The improvement came after sufficient precipitation and warmer than usual conditions were reported across almost all winter crop areas of the country, with temperatures in most regions 0.2-0.9°C higher than the 10-year average in the past November-February period.  Canadian Western Red Spring (CWRS) turned to losses on Monday, offsetting a slight uptick in premiums to the Minneapolis Grain Exchange (MGEX) but moving in line with the global wheat complex.  The 13.5pc spot product closed at $439.75/t fob Vancouver, down by $6.75/t from last week's close. This was also the contract's lowest settlement since 2 March, giving back most of its gains since the start of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Premiums for the best bids and offers were heard in a range of ¢115-135/bu, up from Friday but failing to match sharp futures losses on the MGEX.  Canada's slow export pace could continue to pressure CWRS prices in the coming days. The country's wheat shipments totalled just 154,600t in the week to 20 March, down from 237,700t seven days ago. Cumulative exports since the start of the 2021-22 marketing year reached 7.48mn t, down from 12.54mn t at the same time a year earlier.

Chip shortage could further trim US auto output,28 March 2022,By Rye Druzin,"Automakers in North America could produce nearly 300,000 fewer vehicles than expected in 2022 because of ongoing semiconductor shortages, according to AutoForecast Solutions. At least 16,000 vehicles are expected to be lost, and the production of about 300,000 vehicles is listed as at risk or potentially impacted based on an original annual production estimate of 15.3mn vehicles, the research firm said.

Brazil extends spot thermal generation rules,28 March 2022,By Flávia Pierry,"The Brazilian ministry of mines and energy extended rules for thermal power plant units with no long-term contracts, called merchant plants, through 30 April 2023.  The original set of rules was published in 2021, during the most severe drought in the country in 91 years, in order to avoid power rationing or a shortage amid hydropower generation restrictions.  The rules define how to price thermal power that is not purchased by power distributors in auctions. They allow plants without long-term contracts to add fixed costs to the unitary variable costs (CVU) they report to regulator Aneel, which they will be paid when called on to generate power.  The move signals that government regulators understand they may need to call on plants for power dispatch that typically have higher prices since they purchase fuel on the spot market. The power sector monitoring committee, headed by the ministry, decided to extend the rules even though water reservoirs for power plants have neared the long-term average this year. The rule is aimed at ensuring power reliability despite the ""significant improvement"" in hydropower water levels, the ministry said.

Fortescue boosts W Australian iron ore exports,29 March 2022,None,"Shipments from the four largest iron ore producers in Western Australia's (WA) Pilbara were the strongest for 2022 in the week to 26 March, as Fortescue ramped up output to a record weekly high before the end of the first quarter. Rio Tinto, BHP, Fortescue and Roy Hill loaded vessels with a combined 17.72mn deadweight tonnes (dwt) of capacity, up from 16.9mn dwt in the week to 19 March and 3pc above 12-month average levels, according to initial shipping data collated by Argus. The dwt tonnage is the maximum capacity of the vessel and overestimates actual shipments by around 5pc. Rio Tinto has had a particularly slow start to 2022, with initial shipping data suggesting that January-March shipments were down by nearly 10mn t compared with the same period a year earlier.

"UK offshore oil needs investment, policy support: OEUK",29 March 2022,By Georgia Gratton,"The UK's offshore oil and gas sector needs ""rapid investment in new infrastructure"" to prevent the country from becoming more reliant on imports, industry lobby group OEUK — formerly OGUK — said today. The UK's offshore output ""is in rapid decline"" and will fall by up to 15pc/yr unless there is new investment, which would leave the UK relying on imports to cover 80pc of its gas and 70pc of its oil requirements, according to the OEUK's 2022 business outlook report.  Stubbornly high global energy prices and a pledge by countries in Europe to reduce their dependence on imports of Russian hydrocarbons in the wake of the Ukraine conflict have thrown the issue into sharp relief. ""Energy security is now national security,"" OEUK chief executive Deirdre Michie said.  The group's market intelligence manager Ross Dornan highlighted the importance of being as energy-independent as possible, with ""oil and gas still at the heart of this"".  The IEA's net zero by 2050 roadmap, launched last year, envisaged a world in which no new oil or gas fields are developed. But such a scenario would leave ""the UK and other countries increasingly reliant on Russia and Opec member states"", OEUK said. ""It would push their share of the global oil supply market from 37pc now to 52pc by 2050.""  The group noted that North Sea oil and gas output remains part of the energy mix in both the UK's net zero strategy report and the government advisory Climate Change Committee's balanced pathway — albeit at different rates. The next 12-18 months is a window of opportunity for new investment in oil and gas production, but the industry ""can't overestimate the impact of political support"", Dornan said. Producers ""have to have confidence that they're going to continue to be able to produce [from] their assets,"" he said. They also have to have confidence that there is going to be future licensing, he added. OEUK forecasts investment in the UK's offshore oil and gas sector will be £4bn ($5.24bn) this year, down from £5.5bn in 2019 and £16bn in 2014. Challenges to new investment in the UK North Sea include the basin's maturity, the UK's complex regulatory environment, and political disagreements around issues like climate change and windfall taxes, according to OEUK. The organisation argues against a windfall tax on oil and gas companies, many of which made record profits in 2021, pointing to the tax they already pay and rising supply chain costs.  Despite the slowdown in investment, Dornan noted that UK exploration activity has ""been at record levels"" in the past year and he expects to see that again this year. In terms of development, OEUK expects ""potentially 10"" new final investment decisions this year and emphasised that there is a need for a range of projects, including more production from existing wells and relatively quick tie-backs, as well as new standalone projects that take much longer to see returns.  The UK government, which has pledged to phase out Russian oil imports by the end of the year, has been vocal in recent weeks about the need to increase domestic oil and gas output. It has promised to release an energy supply strategy, although information about a timeframe is vague. OEUK's report heavily focuses on the role of oil and gas in the UK's energy transition, but the group concedes that moving to ""a more diverse and lower carbon mix also provides opportunities to manage the UK's reliance on energy imports"", adding that the country's oil and gas sector is ""steadfast"" in its net-zero commitments. The UK's net zero strategy proposes 40GW of offshore wind, 5GW of hydrogen capacity and 20mn-30mn t/yr of carbon capture and storage (CCS) by 2030. OEUK noted progress in offshore wind but raised concerns about global supply chain capacity, given the sector's rapid development. Both hydrogen and CCS need clarity around their development, OEUK said. The group estimates private-sector investment and operating costs in offshore energy projects in the UK will reach £200bn-250bn in 2022-30, with around 40pc of that going to oil and gas and 60pc to lower-carbon energy. It is ""crucial that there are predictable and long-term commercial and regulatory frameworks in place to attract the required level of capital investment in each of these energy areas"", OEUK said.  The UK's net zero strategy recommends electrification on offshore platforms, and there are ""really active discussions… to remove any blockers to invest in electrification"", Dornan said. OEUK also noted that there will be fewer emissions associated with UK domestic oil and gas production than with imports. ","['<p class=""lead"">The UK\'s offshore oil and gas sector needs ""rapid investment in new infrastructure"" to prevent the country from becoming more reliant on imports, industry lobby group OEUK — formerly OGUK — said today.</p>', '<p>The UK\'s offshore output ""is in rapid decline"" and will fall by up to 15pc/yr unless there is new investment, which would leave the UK relying on imports to cover 80pc of its gas and 70pc of its oil requirements, according to the OEUK\'s 2022 business outlook report. </p>', '<p>Stubbornly high global energy prices and a pledge by countries in Europe to reduce their dependence on imports of Russian hydrocarbons in the wake of the Ukraine conflict have thrown the issue into sharp relief.

The organisation argues against a windfall tax on oil and gas companies, many of which made record profits in 2021, pointing to the tax they already pay and rising supply chain costs. </p>"", '<p>Despite the slowdown in investment, Dornan noted that UK exploration activity has ""been at record levels"" in the past year and he expects to see that again this year. In terms of development, OEUK expects ""potentially 10"" new final investment decisions this year and emphasised that there is a need for a range of projects, including more production from existing wells and relatively quick tie-backs, as well as new standalone projects that take much longer to see returns. </p>', '<p>The UK government, which has pledged to phase out Russian oil imports by the end of the year, has been <a href=""https://direct.argusmedia.com/newsandanalysis/article/2311568"">vocal in recent weeks</a> about the need to increase domestic oil and gas output.

"No politics in Opec+ production decisions: UAE, Saudi",29 March 2022,By Nader Itayim and Bachar Halabi,"Opec+ will always keep politics out of its decisions on oil production, Opec heavyweights Saudi Arabia and the UAE said today, ahead of the wider group meeting this week to discuss output policy for May. The comments come against a backdrop of growing supply-side concerns over the conflict in Ukraine. The IEA earlier this month said at least 3mn b/d of Russian oil output could be forced off line by as early as next month as the sanctions stranglehold on Moscow tightens. Opec+ has held firm to its line that the resultant high prices are is unrelated to the fundamentals of supply and demand, and two of its leading members today doubled down on that. ""We have one mission, which is stabilising the market,"" UAE energy minister Suhail al-Mazrouei told the World Government Summit in Dubai. ""We cannot be politicising or bringing politics into the organisation and having that debate. There are other entities, or other ministries that are in charge of that."" This separation of politics from ""what we are doing"" in Opec+ has stood it in good stead over the years, al-Mazrouei said.  ""I remember in Opec, and now Opec+, we had countries in war, which were both partners [in Opec],"" he said. ""We didn't take a side [then], and were not taking sides today, saying this is right or wrong when we are part of that organisation."" Saudi energy minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, who was also speaking at the World Government Summit, echoed his UAE counterpart's comments, saying Opec members have always managed to ""compartmentalise our political differences"" to work towards the ""common good."" ""That culture has seeped into Opec+,"" he said. ""So, when we get into that meeting room, everybody leaves their politics outside the door of that building. If we didn't do that, we wouldn't have dealt with so many countries at different points. It could have been Iraq at one point, Iran at one point, or others."" The minister referenced the latest spate of drone and ballistic missile attacks by the Iran-linked Houthi rebel group in neighbouring Yemen on key Saudi energy facilities, which has prompted Riyadh to call out the international community for inaction and to warn it would not take ""any responsibility"" for resulting supply outages. ""I ask you, who has been throwing the rockets and missiles at us and at Abu Dhabi? Who is financing, who is training, who is supplying that weaponry?, Prince Abdulaziz said. ""It is a member of Opec. I'll leave it for your imagination."" The reason Opec and Opec+ has held together in the face of such events and heightened tension is that ""we have discussed these matters, and these issues, in an entirely siloed approach, where we are much more focused on the common good, regardless of the politics,"" the prince said. Opec+ ministers are scheduled to meet on 31 March, to discuss whether to increase the group's collective output ceiling for May by 432,000 b/d as planned.","['<p class=""lead"">Opec+ will always keep politics out of its decisions on oil production, Opec heavyweights Saudi Arabia and the UAE said today, ahead of the wider group meeting this week to discuss output policy for May.</p>', '<p>The comments come against a backdrop of growing supply-side concerns over the conflict in Ukraine.

Japan adds to LNG bunkering options,29 March 2022,By Maiko Nakashima,"A Japanese cross-industry group are planning LNG bunkering operations in the Kyushu and Setouchi areas, with the country's third LNG bunker barge to be launched in 2024.  The joint venture Keys Bunkering West Japan today placed an order to build a 3,500m³ LNG bunkering vessel with Japanese shipbuilder Mitsubishi Shipbuilding for a delivery targeted in March 2024, following an initial agreement in September last year. The vessel can run on LNG or marine gasoil. Keys was set up in February, with 40pc each owned by utility Kyushu Electric and shipowner Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK), 15pc owned by trading house Itochu and 5pc by gas retailer Saibu Gas. Marine fuel use LNG will be initially supplied from the Tobata LNG import terminal in north Japan's Kyushu island, which already has loading outlet facilities for LNG bunker barges. The Oita and Hibiki terminals could be other options to deliver LNG after remodelling their infrastructure, Kyushu Electric said.  The barge will be Japan's third LNG bunkering vessel to cover the country's southern Kyushu and western Setouchi area, following the central Ise/Mikawa bay and Tokyo bay regions. The Japanese government is encouraging domestic shipowners to use LNG as a marine fuel, with the ministry of land, infrastructure and tourism in March deciding to provide subsidies for the Kyushu/Setouchi project. LNG bunkering operations will be for oceangoing vessels, such as coal, iron ore and car carriers, especially shipping through the Tsushima, Kanmon and Bungo canals. These are routes connecting the country's industry sectors such as refineries, steel mills and car manufacturing plants. The third barge is also expected to be used as a coastal LNG carrier for consumers in the Kyushu and Setouchi areas. LNG fuel is currently delivered only in Ise/Mikawa bay, starting with an LNG-fuelled car carrier in October 2020 mainly for Japanese auto manufacturer Toyota. A LNG bunkering barge in Kaguya is based at power utility Jera's Kawagoe LNG import terminal in Mie prefecture. LNG bunker barge Eco Bunker Tokyo Bay is ready for LNG bunker operations based at Tokyo Gas's Sodegaura LNG import terminal in Chiba prefecture, with it waiting for LNG bunkering contracts to be finalised.  Japanese shipping firms are expanding their fleet of LNG-fuelled vessels. NYK plans to launch 20 LNG-fuelled car carriers by 2028, while Mitsui OSK Line is seeking to increase the number of LNG-fuelled vessels to 90 by 2030.","['<p class=""lead"">A Japanese cross-industry group are planning LNG bunkering operations in the Kyushu and Setouchi areas, with the country\'s third LNG bunker barge to be launched in 2024. </p>', '<p>The joint venture Keys Bunkering West Japan today placed an order to build a 3,500m³ LNG bunkering vessel with Japanese shipbuilder Mitsubishi Shipbuilding for a delivery targeted in March 2024, following an <a href=""https://direct.argusmedia.com/newsandanalysis/article/2259014"">initial agreement</a> in September last year.

Another Petrobras CEO falls on fuel price conundrum,29 March 2022,By Nathan Walters,"Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro has appointed Adriano Pires as chief executive of oil company Petrobras, prematurely ending former general Joaquim Silva e Luna's tenure at the state-controlled firm. Pires, as Silva e Luna before him, is being brought in to address rising fuel prices, which have drawn the ire of Bolsonaro, consumers, and Brazil's political class but which lack a simple solution.  Silva a Luna was nominated in February 2021 after former chief executive Roberto Castello Branco increased diesel prices against the wishes of Bolsonaro. Now, less than a year after he formally assumed the role, Silva e Luna is likewise being removed because of an 11 March wholesale diesel and gasoline price increase that enraged inflation-wary politicians in Brasilia.  Even with no direct oil industry experience and the appearance of being too closely aligned with Bolsonaro, Silva e Luna managed to maintain a veneer of independence over fuel pricing matters. Importers regularly accused the firm of not adhering to the import price parity principle, but Petrobras did make unpopular price increases in the face of major external shocks — most recently in response to soaring international prices caused by the Russia-Ukraine conflict.  The appointment of Pires, a seasoned pro-market technocrat with consultancy and regulatory experience, is unlikely to cause the severe backlash that marked Silva e Luna's arrival, but his views on the creation of a fuel price stabilization fund and the frequency of price adjustments have drawn criticism. His appointment, which still requires the approval of Petrobras' personnel committee, is expected to be confirmed at a 13 April shareholder meeting that will also see the company's chairman role assumed by industry veteran Rodolfo Landim, a controversial businessman with close ties to Bolsonaro.  Petrobras has repeatedly stumbled in its attempts to balance the demands of investors and those of its controlling shareholder, the federal government, as three of the last four chief executives have been ousted because of disagreements over fuel prices.  Brazil remains dependent on imports to bridge a domestic supply gap, as evidenced by a looming diesel shortage. In 2016, Petrobras, the country's dominant refiner, adopted a market-based fuel pricing policy to attract the imports necessary to meet growing fuel demand and open the country's refining segment to new investors, a plan that has floundered and is unlikely to be helped by the latest leadership change.  Bolsonaro's populist impulses in dealing with Petrobras are well established, but his decision to oust Silva e Luna just months ahead of October elections is not likely to bolster his re-election bid among Brazil's business class. His opponents on the right claim Petrobras should have free rein in setting prices, while those on the left — namely frontrunner Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva — want to wean Brazil off imports by building new refineries. Such investment spending is not currently considered in Petrobras' $68bn 2022-26 spending plan. Before the 2014 oil price collapse, Petrobras was planning to add around 900,000 b/d of new domestic refining capacity, plans that were abandoned in the wake of a massive corruption scandal.

Efforts grow to use 100pc SAF in aircraft engines,29 March 2022,By Giulia Squadrin,"Tests to use 100pc sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in aircraft engines are growing in a bid to surpass the current blending requirements set out by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), which only allow up to 50pc of SAF to be blended with fossil jet fuel. Aircraft manufacturer Airbus has this week performed a first A380 flight powered by 100pc SAF, for which 27t of unblended biojet were provided by TotalEnergies. The SAF was produced in Normandy from waste fats and used cooking oil (UCO). This is the third Airbus aircraft type to fly on 100pc SAF over the last year, the company said.  And today aircraft engine manufacturer Pratt and Whitney entered an initial agreement with Air BP to test the application of SAF blends up to 100pc in its engine testing and research. As part of the agreement, the parties will work collaboratively to explore the viable supply to Pratt and Whitney of SAF blends with up to 100pc SAF for engine and propulsion systems testing through 2024.

Brazil opens consultation on hydropower capacity review,29 March 2022,By Rebecca Gompertz,"Brazil's mines and energy ministry has opened a public consultation over the proposed revision of the nameplate generation capacity of the country's hydroelectric plants. The consultation intends to present the government's proposed default configurations, assumptions, methodology and criteria that will be applied in its proposed revision of the country's 109,420MW of hydroelectric nameplate generation capacity, which accounts for 57pc of Brazil's power matrix. The public consultation will be open until 11 April, through the ministry's website. Hydroelectric plants' nameplate generation capacity is defined by the mines and energy ministry when plants first receive their concessions and their review cannot decrease capacity by more than 10pc of the capacity authorized when a plant is first granted to its operator. There is concern among power market participants in Brazil that real capacity might be running at a deficit against the nameplate number set in contracts, as rivers and other water flows change with time and human activity.

Radical action needed to drive energy transition: Irena,29 March 2022,By Georgia Gratton,"Governments should take ""radical and immediate"" action to ensure the world remains on the pathway to keeping global warming below 2°C, the International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena) said today in its World Energy Transitions Outlook 2022 report. ""It is political will and resolve that will shape the transition path,"" the organisation said.  But it said ""progress across all energy uses has been woefully inadequate."" Nationally determined contributions (NDCs) made under the Paris Agreement and commitments made at the Cop 26 UN climate summit in November ""showed a promising trend,"" but fell short, it said. NDCs should be more ambitious and ""international climate collaboration should dramatically increase,"" Irena said. Multiple and compounding crises — energy security, affordability and decarbonisation — underline the ""pressing need to accelerate the global energy transition,"" Irena said. Any short-term actions must go with a ""steadfast focus"" on the transition in the medium and long-term, and investment in new fossil fuel infrastructure will ""perpetuate the existing risks"" of climate change, Irena said. Irena's pathway to keep global warming to 1.5°C, as per the Paris Agreement, requires global investments of $5.7 trillion/yr until 2030, and it said $700 bn/yr should be redirected away from fossil fuels towards the energy transition. Public financing should double, Irena said, although it estimates most funding will come from the private sector. This could result in reducing CO2 emissions by 37bn t/yr by 2050, but it relies on significant increases in renewable electricity and substantial improvements in energy efficiency — which together would make up 50pc of those CO2 reductions. It also calls for electrification of transport and heating, uptake of hydrogen and bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) and ""last-mile use of carbon capture and storage"" (CCS).  The share of renewables in the power generation mix and the addition of these — particularly wind power and bioenergy — is not on track to reach the targets required, but is moving in the right direction, Irena's report shows. The share of renewables in power generation is 26pc, with a 2050 goal of 90pc, and renewable power additions are at roughly a third of Irena's target of 836 GW/yr. Investment in renewable power and improvements in energy efficiency are also making progress, it said. But solar power additions, renewable district heating, investment in energy efficiency and electric vehicles and linked infrastructure are all off course to meet Irena targets. Hydrogen production, CCS and BECCS and the share of renewables in final energy consumption — which Irena recommends should reach 79pc in 2050 — are also off track.

Corn: Cash and futures move down,29 March 2022,None,"Global corn markets fell on Tuesday, with losses driven by signs of progress in peace talks between Russia and Ukraine.  Offers for Argentinian corn on an fob upriver basis were heard as low as ¢45/bu over the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) May futures contract, down by ¢10/bu on the day. This was despite CBOT corn futures posting steep losses along the curve on Tuesday, with the May contract down by ¢27.2/bu on the day at the time of writing.  In the Black Sea region, Ukrainian corn prices also moved downwards on Tuesday. Offers for April shipment were heard at some $250-252/t DAP Izov, down by as much as $10/t on the day. Bids for May shipment also fell by $5/t from Monday to $245/t DAP Izov. Reduced buying interest was heard for shipment to the southwest, but offers were also down for April shipments on a DAP Chop basis by $5/t to $265/t on Tuesday. In contrast, offers for May shipment on a DAP Chop basis rose by $5/t to $270/t.  On the global corn markets, Turkey's TMO approved the purchase of 100,000t of corn on a cfr basis, rejecting eight out of the 10 received offers in its tender on Monday.  Barley prices moved down on Tuesday on limited demand and in line with the wider grain complex.  Sellers were heard lowering offers for Argentinian barley on a spot basis by $5/t to $375/t fob Necochea on Tuesday, after holding their price levels steady since last week, despite weakening demand.  Elsewhere, Tunisia entered the market seeking to buy 100,000t of feed barley for shipment in May-June, closing on Wednesday.  On the exporter side, both the EU and Canada were seen to slow their barley shipments so far in March. The EU's barley shipments totalled just 1,440t in the week to 27 March, according to provisional EU Commission data, down from 65,150t a week earlier and their second lowest so far this season. And in Canada, barley exports reached 8,000t in the week to 20 March, up from 3,800t seven days ago but further lagging year-ago levels. Cumulative exports so far this season (August-February) stood at 1.69mn t, well below 2.33mn t a year earlier. AAFC expects Canada to export 2.95mn t of barley this marketing year. Taking into account the 49,700t of barley that Canada exported on 28 February-20 March, weekly exports of 63,700t would be required to hit this target, well above March's 16,566 t/week average.","['<p class=""lead"">Global corn markets fell on Tuesday, with losses driven by signs of progress in peace talks between Russia and Ukraine. </p>', '<p>Offers for Argentinian corn on an fob upriver basis were heard as low as ¢45/bu over the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) May futures contract, down by ¢10/bu on the day.

Shanghai port congestion surges ahead of lockdown,29 March 2022,By Michael Connolly,"Vessel queues at the port of Shanghai climbed well above seasonal averages in March, creating the potential for prolonged congestion after China's largest city yesterday entered a staggered lockdown in response to spiking Covid-19 cases. Over the past month, the number of ships waiting to load or discharge in Shanghai increased by roughly five fold to around 300, according to research firm VesselsValue. At the same time last year, roughly 100 vessels were waiting in the port of Shanghai, while the 2017-2021 average for this time of year is around 75 vessels. The bloated vessel queues have primarily been created by dry bulkers and tankers, each of which account for roughly one-third of the total number of vessels waiting in the port. If the lockdowns create logistical problems that prolong the congestion, it would provide upward pressure to freight rates by tightening tonnage supply. Nearly all of the oil tankers waiting in the port are smaller-sized vessels involved almost exclusively in intra-Asia shipments, according to Vortexa data. The government of Shanghai imposed a full lockdown of the Pudong district on the east side of the city's Yangpu river to conduct mass testing for four days starting 28 March. A lockdown of the city's Puxi district, on the west bank, will follow during 1-4 April. Residents are restricted to their homes, and public transport services have been halted. The lockdown follows a spike in the number of total Covid-19 cases, including asymptomatic ones, to over 12,000 in the week ending 25 March. But it comes as a shock to residents, because, as recently as 26 March, city authorities had insisted that a full lockdown would not be necessary due to Shanghai's economic significance.","['<p class=""lead"">Vessel queues at the port of Shanghai climbed well above seasonal averages in March, creating the potential for prolonged congestion after China\'s largest city yesterday entered a staggered lockdown in response to spiking Covid-19 cases.</p>', '<p>Over the past month, the number of ships waiting to load or discharge in Shanghai increased by roughly five fold to around 300, according to research firm VesselsValue.

"Wheat: Prices fall on peace talks, low demand",29 March 2022,None,"Global wheat prices fell on Tuesday as signs of progress in peace talks between Russia and Ukraine weighed and some buyers withheld advancing their purchases. Signs of progress after peace talks held in Istanbul on Tuesday between Russia and Ukraine weighed on global cash and futures wheat markets. Some futures markets even reached technical limits earlier in the trading day. The Russia-Ukraine conflict significantly tightened the wheat supply-demand balance in recent weeks, and the potential of progress in peace talks raise the prospect of increased supply from the region. That said, even in the event of a peace agreement being reached, the return to normal operations of Ukraine's logistical chains could take some time, Argus' agriculture analytics arm Agritel said.  Sellers of Russian 12.5pc milling wheat lowered their offers to around $400/t fob, $7/t below offer levels heard on Monday. And exporters from Argentina offered the Argentinian 11.5pc wheat grade at at $370/t fob upriver on a spot basis, which was $2-3/t lower than the offer range on Monday. Few firm bids were heard to match these offer levels, resulting in limited liquidity on the cash markets. Improving crop conditions in Kansas may have also contributed to the weakness in the wheat market on Tuesday, although conditions in other states were mixed.  While some buyers opted to delay securing volumes in anticipation for further price drops, fresh demand still came from north Africa on Tuesday as Algeria and Tunisia tendered for 50,000t and 150,000t of milling wheat respectively.  Canadian Western Red Spring (CWRS) wheat prices moved down on Tuesday, as rising premiums were not enough to offset a sharp drop in Minneapolis Grain Exchange (MGEX) futures. The 13.5pc protein grade wheat settled at $431.75/t fob Vancouver on Tuesday's close, $8/t lower than Monday. Premiums rose by just ¢5/bu to ¢130/bu over the MGEX May contract, which was nowhere close to offsetting a Minneapolis-listed futures drop of ¢34/bu at the time of writing. CWRS has seen enquiries from buyers in east Africa, Japan, South Korea and southeast Asian countries this week, but continued to lack firm purchasing commitments, market participants said. Some 154,600t of Canadian wheat was shipped in the week to 20 March, bringing the total since the start of the 2021-22 marketing year to 7.5mn t. Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC) expects full 2021-22 marketing year exports to hit 15.55mn t, so the country would need to ship 423,000 t/week to hit this target.

Australian magnetite concentrate exports to grow,29 March 2022,None,"Chinese steelmaker Ansteel has applied to expand the 8mn t/yr Karara magnetite concentrate project in Western Australia (WA) to as much as 37.6mn t/yr, as strong premiums for higher-grade concentrates and more stable production rates drive expansion in the industry. Ansteel envisages developing stage two to reach 15.4mn t/yr, before ramping up to 22.8mn t/yr and then to 37.6mn t/yr over the following stages. This would add to new magnetite concentrate capacity being developed by Australian mining firm Fortescue through its 22mn t/yr Iron Bridge project, which is due to come on stream late this year, and continued improved throughput at Chinese firm Citic's 24mn t/yr Sino Iron project.  Australia's magnetite concentrate industry has had a difficult growth period, with the Karara project only reaching steady state production of 8mn t/yr in 2016-17 after commissioning in 2011 and after Ansteel threatened to cut all funding unless cost savings were made. Sino Iron also experienced significant cost blowouts, technical difficulties and delays during the construction and nine-year ramp-up phase, although it now seems to be operating just below its 24mn t/yr nameplate capacity.  Both projects operated at significant losses during their ramp-up phases, but strong iron ore prices and premiums for high-grade concentrate have seen their profitability turn around in the past few years. Citic reported a 280pc increase in the net profit of its advanced materials segment in January-June 2021 compared with a year earlier, largely because of the strong received prices at Sino Iron. Australia's oldest concentrate and magnetite producer Grange Resources reported a full-year profit of A$321.6mn ($240.7mn) for 2021, up from A$203.2mn in 2020 and compared with a loss of A$277.8mn in 2015.  The increased profitability is prompting a range of new projects to seek financing, including the 70pc Fe 10mn t/yr Hawsons concentrate project in New South Wales and Hancock Prospecting's Mount Bevan project in the Yilgarn region of WA. Argus last assessed Australian iron ore concentrate premiums at $7.30/dry metric tonne (dmt) basis the April 65pc index on 24 March, with cargoes of Karara concentrate awarded through a tender on 10 March at a premium of $7-7.50/dmt.  Argus last assessed the 65pc Fe iron ore price at $178.80/dmt cfr Qingdao on 28 March, up from $140.20/dmt on 1 January and $95.95/dmt five years ago.

Capesize tonnage glut grows in the Atlantic,29 March 2022,By Ross Griffith,"Decreased demand for Capesize tonnage because of sluggish Brazilian iron ore output has led to a buildup of the vessel class in the north Atlantic over the last week, pressuring rates downward in stark contrast to the well supported Panamax market in the Atlantic basin. Argus assessments showed an 8pc drop in coal freight rates from the US east coast to Rotterdam for Capesize vessels yesterday compared with the previous week, down by $1.40/t to $16.05/t. On the same route, the rate for coal carrying Panamax vessels increased by $5.85/t to $30.60/t, up nearly 25pc. Strong demand for South American grain has been raising rates for Atlantic Panamax vessels and thinning tonnage throughout the Atlantic over the last week, while production disruptions for Brazilian iron ore stemming from the ongoing rainy season have removed a significant source of demand for Atlantic Capesize bulkers. Capesize cargoes from the east coast of the US and Canada have similarly been absent from the market, according to a shipbroker, possibly related to railroad delays in both countries affecting coal supply. The lack of cargoes available to Capesize owners in the face of strong Panamax activity in the Atlantic culminated in Capesize vessels competing for Panamax-sized cargoes.","['<p class=""lead"">Decreased demand for Capesize tonnage because of sluggish Brazilian iron ore output has led to a buildup of the vessel class in the north Atlantic over the last week, pressuring rates downward in stark contrast to the well supported Panamax market in the Atlantic basin.</p>', '<p>Argus assessments showed an 8pc drop in coal freight rates from the US east coast to Rotterdam for Capesize vessels yesterday compared with the previous week, down by $1.40/t to $16.05/t.

"YPF, Petrobras low-sulphur coke pricing surges",29 March 2022,By Lauren Masterson,"Two tenders for low-sulphur Latin American anode-grade coke are closing early this week, with bids heard at substantially higher levels than prior cargoes of this grade. Brazil state-controlled Petrobras and Argentina state-controlled YPF issued tenders offering less than 1pc sulphur calcinable coke with bids due on 28 and 29 March, respectively. Market participants expect both cargoes to sell for potentially hundreds more than the companies' last export cargoes.  Petrobras indicated in its tender that it expects to receive at least $625/wet metric tonne on an fob Imbituba basis, which is higher than its last tender was heard to sell for on a cfr China basis. The cargo is 30,000t, with such smaller vessels currently commanding a high per tonne freight rate in the low-to-mid $100s/t from Brazil to China, traders said. The freight rate from YPF's La Plata port is typically even higher to China, particularly since this cargo is only 24,000t.  Bidders are weighing other recent low-sulphur coke tenders that sold for eye-popping prices in China. A cargo of low-sulphur coke from Indonesia recently sold at over $900/wmt cfr China when considering final index prices, participants said. This compares with pricing heard in the $500s/t on a cfr China basis for the refinery's prior cargo earlier this year. ""We are unable to compete with Chinese traders in Indonesia,"" one calciner said.

"US weighs solar tariffs, unsettling industry",29 March 2022,By Patrick Zemanek,"The US Department of Commerce has opened an investigation into solar modules imported from four countries in southeast Asia, a probe that solar advocates warn could cut supplies and stall efforts to address climate change. The International Trade Administration, the Commerce agency responsible for protecting US businesses from unfair pricing by foreign companies, yesterday said it will investigate whether solar products completed in and exported from Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam are circumventing US solar duties. Those four countries account for over half of the non-Chinese solar cell imports into the US, according to engineering services group Clean Energy Associates (CEA). Because the investigation could result in retroactive tariffs on solar imports from those countries, the probe will slow solar industry growth even before the case is decided, industry groups said. Imposing tariffs also would undercut President Joe Biden's push to decarbonize the US grid, solar advocates warn. ""Without a reliable supply of solar modules while this investigation proceeds, project construction will grind to a halt, American workers risk being laid-off or furloughed, and we will miss our emissions targets,"" industry group American Clean Power Association chief executive Heather Zichal said. Commerce's decision to open the case ""chokes off up to 80pc of the solar panel supply to the US,"" Zichal said. The investigation answers a petition filed on 8 February by California-based photovoltaic panel assembler Auxin Solar, alleging imports from Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam are allowing Chinese solar components to avoid duties imposed by the agency in 2012. The duties apply to crystalline silicon photovoltaic cells as well as modules, laminates and panels consisting of those cells. Auxin Solar said that manufacturers in the four countries are using components that originated in China and should therefore be included in the scope of the 2012 orders, citing laws that give the agency authority to find that duties should apply to certain components even if outside ""the order's literal scope."" Commerce secretary Gina Raimondo would be able to apply any duties retroactively, to as far back as November 2021, according CEA. Suppliers have indicated they may stop shipments from the countries in question until the agency issues its final ruling, expected in the first part of 2023. Module suppliers in countries that were not named in the investigation will ""likely"" raise prices in response, CEA said. Some countries with established suppliers — including Canada, Germany, Mexico and South Korea — are geared to manufacture products for smaller, distributed solar projects, not utility-scale systems.  The Commerce decision ""responds to the self-interests of one company,"" and will lead to increased market volatility and job losses in the US, Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) chief executive Abigail Ross Hopper said. Before Commerce decided to open the latest investigation, SEIA reduced its forecast for solar capacity to be added to the US grid in 2021-22 by 11,000MW, or 19pc, compared to its expectation last September. ""The solar industry is still reeling from a similar tariff petition that surfaced last year,"" Hopper said, referring to a petition denied by Commerce in November. ""The mere threat of tariffs altered the industry's growth trajectory and is one of the reasons why we are now expecting a 19pc decline in near-term solar forecasts."" Commerce will publish its preliminary determination 150 days after the official investigation notice is published in the Federal Register. Auxin Solar did not immediately respond to a request for comment on concerns about its petition.","['<p class=""lead"">The US Department of Commerce has opened an investigation into solar modules imported from four countries in southeast Asia, a probe that solar advocates warn could cut supplies and stall efforts to address climate change.</p>', '<p>The International Trade Administration, the Commerce agency responsible for protecting US businesses from unfair pricing by foreign companies, yesterday said it will investigate whether solar products completed in and exported from Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam are circumventing US solar duties.</p>', ""<p>Those four countries account for over half of the non-Chinese solar cell imports into the US, according to engineering services group Clean Energy Associates (CEA).

US HRC: Prices rise slower as mills pause,29 March 2022,None,"US hot-rolled coil (HRC) prices continued to increase in the last week but at slower rates than previously, as some mills took a pause in price increases as they reviewed their raw material costs. The Argus weekly domestic US HRC Midwest assessment rose by $50/short ton to $1,452/st, the smallest increase in the last four weeks. The southern HRC assessment rose by $38/st to $1,440/st.  The Midwest price was up by 42pc since hitting a low of $1,022.50/st on 1 March. HRC lead times in the Midwest slipped to 5-6 weeks from 6-7 weeks, as most mills were still waiting to open up their May books. HRC was offered at between $1,400-1,500/st. Raw material price expectations continued to weigh on the market, with many believing that prime scrap will increase by more than $100/gross ton (gt) in the April trade, which could begin next week. Some expect of price increases of $150-200/gt.  The April scrap trade is expected to be more straightforward than March, when many steel mills were caught flat footed by rapidly rising prices that ended up increasing #1 busheling by $175-190/gt.  HRC import prices into Houston were flat at $1,250/st ddp on no new offers. The spread between #1 busheling scrap delivered US Midwest mills and HRC selling prices rose by 6.3pc to $843/st. A year ago the spread was $800/st. The spread between pig iron cfr New Orleans and Midwest and southern HRC prices rose by 8.2pc compared to the prior week to $536/st. The Argus weekly domestic US cold-rolled coil (CRC) assessment rose by $50/st to $1,850/st, while the hot-dipped galvanized (HDG) assessment jumped increased by $28/st to $1,848/st. Mill offers were reported between $1,800-1,900/st. Lead times for CRC widened to 6-8 weeks from 6-7 weeks while HDG lead times rose to 7-8 weeks from 6-7 weeks. The CME HRC Midwest futures market moved down in the last week after multiple weeks of increases. May futures pricing fell by $50/st to $1,570/st compared to the last week, while June pricing was down by $39/st to $1,561/st. July future pricing declined by $26/st to $1,535/st, while August futures fell by $28/st to $1,495/st. September futures also moved down by $25/st to $1,480/st, while October futures are at $1,435/st. The Argus weekly domestic US ex-works plate assessment rose by $26/st to $1,881/st on an increase from integrated steelmaker Cleveland-Cliffs.

Australia’s Santos deepens 2030 GHG reduction target,30 March 2022,By Kevin Morrison,"Australian independent Santos plans to deepen its greenhouse gas (GHG) emission cuts to 30pc for scope one and two emissions by 2030, up from its previous target of 26-28pc by the end of the decade. Scope one covers emissions produced from the extraction of oil and gas and scope two covers emissions released from the energy used in the extraction process. The revised target was announced in Santos' 2022 climate change report released today and includes the operations it acquired through the A$21bn ($15.8bn) merger with fellow independent Oil Search that was completed in December. The previous GHG reduction target was made before the merger. An additional 2030 target was announced, with Santos pledging to cut at least 1.5mn t of CO2/yr from the supply of clean fuels. It maintained its 2040 target of net zero GHG emissions for its scope one and two emissions. The combined Santos and Oil Search equity scope one and two emissions totalled 5.9mn t of CO2 equivalent (CO2e) in the 2019-20 fiscal year to 30 June, meaning a 30pc cut would translate to 4.1mn t of CO2e by 2030. Santos also plans to raise its LNG exports over the rest of the decade. Its equity LNG exports reached 4.56mn t in 2021 and are expected to rise to 7.15mn t/yr by 2025, Santos said. Santos has proposed investing mostly in carbon capture and storage (CCS) facilities to achieve its 2030 GHG reduction targets. Potential capital investment in the 2022-2030 period includes $110mn for the sanctioned 1.7mn t/yr Moomba CCS project in the onshore Cooper basin in South Australia, a cumulative $400mn for a series of proposed energy efficiency projects and possibly $3.1bn-5bn for other CCS and clean fuel hubs, depending on final equity interest and customer demand, Santos said. Santos has plans for other CCS plants, in addition to Moomba. The upstream firm intends to build a CCS plant at the Bayu-Undan field in the Timor Sea, as well as at the Reindeer gas field in the Carnarvon basin offshore Western Australia and in Papua New Guinea, where Santos has interests in the 6.9mn t/yr PNG LNG and 5.3mn t/yr Papua LNG ventures. Projects throughout 2021 and into 2022 will reduce fuel, flare and vent emissions by over 150,000 t/yr of CO2e through the deployment of 24 more wells converted into solar and battery in the Cooper basin and the recovery of flared gas at Moomba, as well as the Fairview and Roma fields in Queensland, Santos said.","['<p class=""lead"">Australian independent Santos plans to deepen its greenhouse gas (GHG) emission cuts to 30pc for scope one and two emissions by 2030, up from its previous target of 26-28pc by the end of the decade.</p>', '<p>Scope one covers emissions produced from the extraction of oil and gas and scope two covers emissions released from the energy used in the extraction process.</p>', '<p>The revised target was announced in Santos\' 2022 climate change report released today and includes the operations it acquired through the <a href=""https://direct.argusmedia.com/newsandanalysis/article/2281525"">A$21bn ($15.8bn) merger with fellow independent Oil Search</a> that was completed in December.

US oil executives to testify on gasoline prices,29 March 2022,By Chris Knight,"Top executives from ExxonMobil, Chevron, BP and Shell will appear before the US House of Representatives in a hearing next week meant to address growing frustration from drivers paying record-high prices for gasoline and diesel in the US. ExxonMobil chief executive Darren Woods, Chevron chief executive Michael Wirth, BP America president David Lawler and Shell USA president Gretchen Watkins have agreed to testify at the 6 April hearing, the House Energy and Commerce Committee said. Devon Energy chief executive Richard Muncrief and Pioneer Natural Resources chief executive Scott Sheffield also plan to testify. The committee's Democratic majority wants to use the hearing to argue that oil industry business practices are partially to blame for a spike in gasoline prices, which hit a record weekly high of $4.31/USG in the US earlier this month. Republicans are likely to use the hearing to argue high prices were caused by President Joe Biden's energy policies, such as limiting federal oil and gas leasing and canceling the proposed 830,000 b/d Keystone XL pipeline. US retail gasoline prices have jumped about $1/USG over the last two months, primarily as the market reacted to Russia's decision to send troops into Ukraine and corresponding sanctions related to the conflict. Democrats and Republicans for weeks have sought to channel voter frustration over those price spike onto the oil sector or to policies at the White House. The upcoming hearing marks the second time in six months that top US oil executives will offer testimony before Congress, although the executives have the option of appearing virtually. Woods, Wirth, Lawler and Watkins all appeared virtually in a 28 October hearing before the House Oversight Committee to discuss their past work on climate change policy.","['<p class=""lead"">Top executives from ExxonMobil, Chevron, BP and Shell will appear before the US House of Representatives in a hearing next week meant to address growing frustration from drivers paying record-high prices for gasoline and diesel in the US.</p>', '<p>ExxonMobil chief executive Darren Woods, Chevron chief executive Michael Wirth, BP America president David Lawler and Shell USA president Gretchen Watkins have agreed to testify at the 6 April hearing, the House Energy and Commerce Committee said.

UK extends Cambo field licences for two years,30 March 2022,By Jon Mainwaring,"Siccar Point Energy said today it has received an extension for the licences that cover its controversial Cambo oil and gas field in the UK offshore. The P1028 and P1189 licences were to expire on 31 March.

Japanese firms target hydrogen supply chain in Kawasaki,30 March 2022,By Nanami Oki,"Six Japanese companies across various industries and the city of Kawasaki have agreed to explore development of a hydrogen supply chain in the coastal area of Kawasaki city on the back of their decarbonisation goals. Refiner Eneos, petrochemical producers Asahi Kasei and Showa Denko, engineering company Toshiba Energy Systems and Solutions, infrastructure firm East Japan Railway, amino acid and healthcare provider Ajinomoto and Kawasaki city plan to investigate potential hydrogen demand and the possibility of building a supply chain within the area in east Japan's Kanagawa prefecture. They are targeting generating and clarifying hydrogen demand in the area to urge suppliers to boost imports and production while reducing purchasing costs. The partners also aim to evaluate useful technology and build partnerships with hydrogen suppliers. The partners chose the coastal area of Kawasaki to take advantage of major potential consumers in the area like gas-fired power generation plants, refineries, petrochemical complexes, plants and airports, as well as existing infrastructure such as ports, terminals and hydrogen pipelines. Japanese companies and governments have promoted hydrogen for the country's 2050 decarbonisation target. Eneos is studying the feasibility of carbon-free hydrogen supply chains in Kawasaki and in Mutsu Ogawara in north Japan's Aomori prefecture, targeting to complete the study by the end of March 2023. Eneos also agreed with Kawasaki city in November last year to expand hydrogen use and supplies. Fellow Japanese refiner Cosmo Energy and industrial gas supplier Iwatani earlier this month also decided to co-operate on setting up hydrogen supply chains including imports and building hydrogen filling stations.","['<p class=""lead"">Six Japanese companies across various industries and the city of Kawasaki have agreed to explore development of a hydrogen supply chain in the coastal area of Kawasaki city on the back of their decarbonisation goals.</p>', ""<p>Refiner Eneos, petrochemical producers Asahi Kasei and Showa Denko, engineering company Toshiba Energy Systems and Solutions, infrastructure firm East Japan Railway, amino acid and healthcare provider Ajinomoto and Kawasaki city plan to investigate potential hydrogen demand and the possibility of building a supply chain within the area in east Japan's Kanagawa prefecture.</p>"", '<p>They are targeting generating and clarifying hydrogen demand in the area to urge suppliers to boost imports and production while reducing purchasing costs.

Covid-19 cuts Japan’s energy emissions in FY 2020-21,30 March 2022,By Motoko Hasegawa,"Japan's energy-related CO2 emissions fell by around 83mn t in the April 2020-March 2021 fiscal year, as the Covid-19 pandemic limited economic activity and reduced energy consumption in the country.  Japan's CO2 emissions derived from energy use fell by 82.9mn t in 2020-21, following a 7.2mn t reduction in February-March 2020, the last two months of the 2019-20 fiscal year when Covid-19 began to spread, according to the latest survey by the environment ministry.  The fall in the 2020-21 energy-related CO2 emissions contributed to a 5.1pc year-on-year decline in Japan's overall greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for the year, which were preliminary estimated at 1.149bn t of CO2 equivalent (CO2e).  Energy-related CO2 emissions from the country's industry and commercial sectors were estimated to have fallen by 51.1mn t and by 14.9mn t respectively between February 2020 and March 2021 because of Covid-19 restrictions, along with a 27.6mn t reduction in the transportation sector. But CO2 emissions generated from energy use by households rose by 3.6mn t as people spent more time at home to limit the spread of the virus.  Japan has pledged to cut GHG emissions by 46pc by 2030-31 compared with 2013-14 levels, before achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. This means the country would have to reduce its GHG emissions to 760mn t CO2e in 2030-31 from 2013-14 levels.","['<p class=""lead"">Japan\'s energy-related CO2 emissions fell by around 83mn t in the April 2020-March 2021 fiscal year, as the Covid-19 pandemic limited economic activity and reduced energy consumption in the country. </p>', ""<p>Japan's CO2 emissions derived from energy use fell by 82.9mn t in 2020-21, following a 7.2mn t reduction in February-March 2020, the last two months of the 2019-20 fiscal year when Covid-19 began to spread, according to the latest survey by the environment ministry. </p>"", '<p>The fall in the 2020-21 energy-related CO2 emissions contributed to a 5.1pc year-on-year decline in Japan\'s overall greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for the year, which were <a href=""https://direct.argusmedia.com/newsandanalysis/article/2281995"">preliminary estimated at 1.149bn t of CO2 equivalent</a> (CO2e). </p>', ""<p>Energy-related CO2 emissions from the country's industry and commercial sectors were estimated to have fallen by 51.1mn t and by 14.9mn t respectively between February 2020 and March 2021 because of Covid-19 restrictions, along with a 27.6mn t reduction in the transportation sector.

Paraná: Plantio do milho inverno chega a 97pc,30 March 2022,Por Nathalia Giannetti,"O estado do Paraná está quase finalizando o plantio da segunda safra de milho 2021-22, também conhecida como milho inverno. Na semana encerrada em 28 de março, 97pc da área estimada para a segunda safra do grão já havia sido plantada, alta de 3 pontos percentuais em relação à semana anterior e em linha com o ritmo registrado há um ano para a temporada 2020-21, segundo o Departamento de Economia Rural (Deral-PR). As lavouras de milho inverno consideradas de boa qualidade subiram de 95pc para 97pc na semana, enquanto aquelas classificadas em condições médias caíram 2 pontos. O Deral espera que a segunda safra de milho desta temporada produza 15,5 milhões de toneladas (t) de milho inverno, o triplo do volume de 2020-21. A colheita do milho verão alcançou 85pc, acima dos 80pc da semana passada e dos 82pc do ano anterior. As lavouras da primeira safra do grão classificadas como de boa qualidade subiram 1 ponto, para 53pc, enquanto as áreas em condições ruins caíram e aquelas classificadas como de média qualidade permaneceram em 32pc. Em 28 de março, a colheita de soja 2021-22 estava 83pc concluída, avançando 8 pontos em relação à semana anterior, mas 5 pontos atrás da mesma semana do ano passado.

European ports look into 'green' shipping corridors,30 March 2022,By James Marriott,"A group of northern European and Baltic ports are seeking to demonstrate the feasibility of alternative marine fuel supply chains and the creation of new 'green' shipping corridors. Ports including Gdynia, Hamburg, Roenne, Rotterdam and Tallinn are looking to champion early commercialisation of alternative marine fuels with Maersk Mc-Kinney Moller Center for Zero Carbon Shipping. The group plans to scale up alternative fuel supply chains and provide a blueprint for green corridors in other locations. No timeline was given for the project. ""To achieve maritime sector decarbonisation, zero-emission fuels and vessels must be deployed at scale over the next decade,"" said Port of Tallinn chief executive Valdo Kalm. This is possible thanks to ""the formation of green corridors in which major ports provide the necessary zero-carbon fuels at the required scale for bunkering."" A similar agreement was signed in February by the Singapore-based Global Centre for Maritime Decarbonisation (GCMD) to provide further momentum to decarbonisation through green corridors. The International Maritime Organisation (IMO) calls for lower carbon emissions in the shipping industry by at least 40pc by 2030, and 70pc by 2050 compared to 2008 levels.","['<p class=""lead"">A group of northern European and Baltic ports are seeking to demonstrate the feasibility of alternative marine fuel supply chains and the creation of new \'green\' shipping corridors.</p>', '<p>Ports including Gdynia, Hamburg, Roenne, Rotterdam and Tallinn are looking to champion early commercialisation of alternative marine fuels with Maersk Mc-Kinney Moller Center for Zero Carbon Shipping.

Tax breaks threaten Venezuela petchems: Survey,30 March 2022,By Carlos Camacho,"Tax breaks granted for petrochemical imports into Venezuela starting in 2018 are hindering a post-Covid-19 recovery in the domestic industry, according to a survey from the private-sector petrochemical industry group Asoquim. Tax-free imports of chemicals and plastics products into Venezuela began in mid-2018, part of an effort by the administration of President Nicholas Maduro to combat US sanctions. The imports are exempted from a 16pc-plus IVA VAT-like tax. According to the survey, taken in the fourth quarter of 2021, 74pc of Venezuelan petrochemical companies are operating at 40pc of their capacity or less. In terms of sales, 53.5pc of those surveyed said sales rose compared to the fourth quarter 2020, 23.7pc said they were flat, and 21.1pc said they fell. Of the companies polled, 60.7pc increased production from a year earlier, while almost 30pc reported a decrease in output. While overall the survey indicated a recovery, it was from a time of particularly low demand in then of 2020 at the depths of the pandemic, Asoquim said. Maduro has started to promise liberalization of the petchems industry, which has the industry calling for an end to the tax-free imports, which covered everything from paints, enamels, lubricants, and household and industrial hygiene products — including buckets and small containers — ""which for years have been manufactured in the country with quality and competitive prices"", Asoquim said.","['<p class=""lead"">Tax breaks granted for petrochemical imports into Venezuela starting in 2018 are hindering a post-Covid-19 recovery in the domestic industry, according to a survey from the private-sector petrochemical industry group Asoquim.</p>', '<p>Tax-free imports of chemicals and plastics products into Venezuela began in mid-2018, part of an effort by the administration of President Nicholas Maduro to combat US sanctions.

Turkish steel exporters get no US court relief,30 March 2022,By Rye Druzin,"The US Supreme Court has denied a petition by Turkish steel exporters to review a lower court's opinion that the president can hike existing Section 232 steel tariffs. The high court declined to review the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit 2-1 decision in July that said the president is allowed to change 232 tariff rates after a tariff has been applied. The plaintiffs in the case were Turkish exporters Transpacific Steel, Borusan Mannesmann Boru Sanayi Ve Ticaret, Borusan Mannesmann Pipe US and Jordan International. The case revolves around then-president Donald Trump's decision to raise tariffs on steel imports from Turkey to 50pc in August 2018 from their original 25pc imposed in March of that year. The tariffs on Turkey fell back down to 25pc in May 2019. Since President Joe Biden assumed office in January 2021, the US has made non-tariffed quota deals with the EU, Japan and the UK. The US already had existing deals with Argentina, Brazil and South Korea, and allows unlimited non-tariffed steel imports from Australia, Canada and Mexico.  The duties — which included a 10pc tariff on imported aluminum products — were originally imposed under Section 232 as Trump determined the US steel industry was threatened by imports, causing a national security threat. Part of the tariffs' purpose was to help boost steel capacity utilization rates to at least 80pc, the rate the industry said it required to remain profitable. Prior to the Covid-19 pandemic reaching the US, the industry was operating above the 80pc threshold for three consecutive months, according to the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI). During the depths of the pandemic response-induced economic recession, the steel industry's utilization rates fell to 51.1pc at the beginning of May 2020. Since the week ending 29 May 2021, US steel capacity utilization rates have been above 80pc, averaging nearly 83pc through the week ending 26 March.","['<p class=""lead"">The US Supreme Court has denied a petition by Turkish steel exporters to review a lower court\'s opinion that the president can hike existing Section 232 steel tariffs.</p>', '<p>The high court declined to review the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit 2-1 decision in July that said <a href=""https://metals.argusmedia.com/NewsAndAnalysis/Article/2234631"">the president is allowed to change 232 tariff rates</a> after a tariff has been applied.</p>', '<p>The plaintiffs in the case were Turkish exporters Transpacific Steel, Borusan Mannesmann Boru Sanayi Ve Ticaret, Borusan Mannesmann Pipe US and Jordan International.</p>', ""<p>The case revolves around then-president Donald Trump's decision to raise tariffs on steel imports from Turkey to 50pc in August 2018 from their original 25pc imposed in March of that year.</p>"", '<p>The tariffs on Turkey <a href=""https://metals.argusmedia.com/newsandanalysis/article/1905020"">fell back down to 25pc in May 2019</a>.</p>', '<p>Since President Joe Biden assumed office in January 2021, the US has made non-tariffed quota deals with the EU, Japan and the UK.

Romania shifts corn exports outside of EU,30 March 2022,None,"Romanian corn exports in October-February of the 2021-22 marketing year were focused on the Middle East at the expense of EU-27 member states, which have partially turned to France for supply of crop.  The EU-27's multi-year high corn export volumes to third countries over October-February are mostly thanks to surging corn exports from Romania. Romanian corn exports to third countries peaked at the start of the corn marketing year in October (see chart), subsequently surpassing multi-year records and staying well above the pace of the previous seven marketing years. This was in part because of delayed corn exports from Ukraine, caused by wet weather in September and logistical problems that persisted well into November.  But Romania's corn exports stayed at multi-year highs even as those of Ukraine also surged to record highs in late January. Romania exported 3.15mn t of corn in October-February, according to lineup data, most of it to non-EU members (see chart). Romania usually exports 1.5mn-3mn t of corn, which this year could rise by 10-20pc from last year, according the Romanian corn growers' association APPR executive director Alina Cretu. But the country's corn stocks are already running low and exports could significantly slow in April before new crop hits the market in autumn, Cretu said.  Romanian corn exports to other EU-27 member states fell in October-February (see chart). The steepest reductions on the year were to Italy, the Netherlands, France and Spain. This came as France's bumper harvest in the 2021-22 season saw the country export record volumes to other bloc members. Spain — the largest importer of Romanian wheat in the EU-27 — imported less Romanian corn on the year in October-February, but slightly above the previous five-year average. And last season's Romanian corn imports to Spain may have been uncharacteristically high, replacing reduced imports from Ukraine — 1.17mn t in October-February 2020-21, compared with 1.77mn t in October-January 2021-22 and averaging 1.63mn t for October-February over the previous five marketing years.  And Spain imported more corn from France in 2021-22, putting pressure on Romanian corn import volumes.  Dutch corn imports from Romania fell by 73pc on the year in October-February to 71,600t — also well below the five-year average of 197,800t. But the decrease may have been offset by rising exports of French and German corn, despite reduced shipments from Romania and Ukraine.  Italy's imports from Romania also fell on the year in October-February — down by 86pc to 40,600t — and well below the last five-year average of 334,500t. But Italy's receipts for French corn rose on the year, partially offsetting reduced Romanian corn volumes.  Belgium increased Romanian corn exports on the year in October-February to 64,900t, up from 3,600t in 2020-21 and above the previous five-year average of 7,700t.  As for non-members, Iran's imports of Romanian corn surged in October-February and were well above the previous five-year average on reduced shipments of Brazilian corn.

The IEA's potential removal from the panel will be discussed at tomorrow's Opec+ meeting. The reason is not immediately clear, but the energy watchdog has been critical of Opec+ recently, saying it is not doing enough to help tackle high energy prices. Earlier this month IEA executive director Fatih Birol described the group's decision to stick with a 400,000 b/d increase in its April crude quota as ""disappointing"". Opec+ has not yet veered from the roadmap it agreed in July last year, opting to limit its production quota increases to 400,000 b/d each month and resisting pressure from outside the group for bigger hikes.

Air New Zealand plans equity raising,31 March 2022,By Kevin Morrison,"Air New Zealand plans to raise NZ$1.2bn ($835mn) in equity, with the funds used to partly repay debts after receiving emergency state aid because of business disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. But the New Zealand government will still participate in the equity rights offer to maintain its 51pc stake, the airline said. A further NZ$600mn of redeemable shares will be issued to the government under an existing agreement struck in December. A new committed unsecured four-year loan of NZ$400mn will be provided from the government, the airline said. Proceeds from the equity offer and the redeemable share issue will be used to repay the NZ$850mn outstanding under the existing government loan. Air New Zealand's operations have been severely affected for the past two years, with international flights around 90pc below their pre-Covid-19 levels and domestic flights still yet to recover to pre-pandemic levels. ""While there will still be bumpy skies ahead over the next few years, the moment is right for Air New Zealand to raise equity, recapitalise its balance sheet and repay the loan it received from the crown during the Covid crisis,"" Air New Zealand chair Therese Walsh said. The government provided NZ$900mn in emergency funding to the airline in March 2020 and a further NZ$500mn in funding was provided in December.  Air New Zealand now expects its 2021-22 full-year result to be a loss before other significant items and taxation of less than NZ$800mn.  Future fuel prices are uncertain, especially given the current conflict in Ukraine, the airline said. ""Air New Zealand may be unable to offset fuel price increases through hedging, fare increases or adjustments to its network or cost structure, potentially impacting future profitability,"" it said.","['<p class=""lead"">Air New Zealand plans to raise NZ$1.2bn ($835mn) in equity, with the funds used to partly repay debts after receiving emergency state aid because of business disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>', '<p>But the New Zealand government will still participate in the equity rights offer to maintain its 51pc stake, the airline said.

ThyssenKrupp to renegotiate annual auto contracts,30 March 2022,By Colin Richardson,"German steelmaker ThyssenKrupp is trying to renegotiate auto automotive contracts for 2022 finalised around January, according to market sources. The mill, which is heavily exposed to the automotive sector, wants to restore the kind of margins it initially achieved and pass on further increases in raw material costs. It is seeking increases of €300-320/t, according to sources at automotive companies. No letters have been sent yet, but talks with original equipment manufacturers will start in the coming weeks. Half-yearly deals with service centres and tier suppliers will not be renegotiated at this time. The mill finalised its auto contracts in the region of €900-1,000/t base depending on the customer and will be looking to move this towards €1,200/t and above, closer to spot levels — Argus' benchmark northwest Europe HRC index, the settlement basis for futures contracts on the LME and CME, had risen from €900/t at the start of January to €1,387.50/t yesterday. The benchmark has jumped by €417.50/t this month alone. The cost of raw materials used by blast furnace-based mills, adjusted for consumption rates, had risen from $536/t at the start of January to $666/t yesterday, without accounting for increases in energy costs. Automakers are unlikely to acquiesce to the renegotiation, which threatens the very fabric of the bilateral annual pricing mechanism, as the initial accords were concluded at record levels and at increases of €400-500/t on 2021 deals. It remains to be seen whether other mills will follow suit.

"Canberra eyes gas rule change to include H2, biomethane",31 March 2022,By Kevin Morrison,"Australian energy regulators have proposed drafting a change of rules governing the gas sector to allow the blending of hydrogen and biomethane in gas pipeline networks around the country.  The recommendation comes after a review of the rules was conducted to encourage the development of Australia's hydrogen sector. The Australian Energy Market Commission (Aemc) has proposed changes to the national gas and energy retail rules to allow hydrogen and biomethane to be blended with gas in pipelines. The draft recommendation is one of 25 proposed changes to stimulate the production and use of hydrogen, a key energy policy for the Australian federal government and the six state governments. The reforms in the regulatory framework will lay the foundation for the development of a decarbonised gas sector in Australia, Aemc chair Anna Collyer said.  ""Hydrogen is one of a handful of new, low carbon, zero-emissions fuels that can be used for heating and cooking in homes,"" she added. ""In the future, the hydrogen sector may grow to include power generation and some industrial processes,"" Collyer said.  These reforms are considered a priority under the Australian government's national hydrogen strategy and the Aemc needs to make sure the changes are delivered in an efficient and secure way, Collyer said. The proposed reforms follow an agreement between federal and state energy ministers in September to extend the regulations governing natural gas to other fuel sources that can be blended with gas in pipelines, such as hydrogen and biomethane. Gas pipeline operators in eastern Australia are working on projects to blend hydrogen into their gas pipeline systems as part of a long-term effort to reduce the greenhouse gas (GHG) emission intensity of producing and consuming gas.  Australian Gas Infrastructure (AGIG), which is owned by Hong Kong-based conglomerate CK, is working on a pilot project to use a 5pc hydrogen blend in its gas pipelines to supply consumers in a suburb in South Australia's state capital Adelaide, as part of a wider plan to use a 10pc hydrogen blend in its gas networks in Victoria and South Australia. The federal and state energy minister said last month in a joint statement that plans to revise its gas regulations to include regulating the blending of hydrogen and biomethane in gas networks has found that existing rules could accommodate the blending of the two fuels, but would require changes to rules covering local gas markets in Sydney, Brisbane and Adelaide, as well as rules governing the gas market in the state of Victoria.","['<p class=""lead"">Australian energy regulators have proposed drafting a change of rules governing the gas sector to allow the blending of hydrogen and biomethane in gas pipeline networks around the country. </p>', ""<p>The recommendation comes after a review of the rules was conducted to encourage the development of Australia's hydrogen sector.

Japan sees oil product use falling over next five years,31 March 2022,By Maiko Nakashima and Nanami Oki,"Japanese oil product demand is forecast to decline by an average 1.5pc/yr over the next five years, with the country's 2050 carbon-neutral target accelerating electrification and decarbonisation efforts. Japan's economy, trade and industry ministry (Meti) predicts that overall domestic oil product consumption will drop to 2.44mn b/d in the April 2026-March 2027 fiscal year, down by 7.1pc from an estimated 2.6mn b/d in 2021-22. Demand will likely continue to fall until 2026-27, following a recovery from a Covid-19-triggered slump in the 2021-22 fiscal year. Japan's carbon-neutral goal is prompting electric vehicle (EV) expansion and a move to alternative fuels such as hydrogen and ammonia. This is expected to accelerate a decline in the country's oil product demand on a mid- to long-term basis, Meti said. Gasoline demand is forecast to drop to 703,000 b/d in 2026-27, down by 9.8pc from 779,000 b/d in 2021-22, pressured by increased fuel efficiency and the EV shift. The government last year set a target for new commercial vehicles that are smaller than 8t by weight to be fully electrified or powered by carbon-neutral fuels after 2040. Japan also pledged to ban the sales of new gasoline-only cars and shift to passenger EVs by 2035. Naphtha consumption is expected to decline to 692,000 b/d in 2026-27, down by 5.7pc from 733,000 b/d in 2021-22 on the back of weaker domestic demand. The 2026-27 forecast is also lower than 2020-21 demand of 693,000 b/d. Diesel demand is projected to inch down by 0.3pc from 554,000 b/d in 2021-22 to 552,000 b/d in 2026-27. The decline is not as much as the fall in demand for other oil products, as the number of commercial trucks are increasing. Kerosine demand is forecast to drop to 206,000 b/d in 2026-27, down by 14.2pc from 240,000 b/d in 2021-22, because of the country's fuel transition and energy efficiency improvements, as well as efforts to limit global warming. Heavy fuel oil demand is expected to fall to 214,000 b/d in 2026-27, down by 18.8pc from 263,000 b/d in 2021-22. A decline in the country's working population in the agriculture and fisheries sectors and a fall in the number of coastal vessels, as well as a shift to alternative fuels, will likely slash fuel oil demand. Jet fuel is only refined oil product for which demand is expected to rise over the next five years, following a slump triggered by the pandemic. Meti forecasts domestic aviation fuel use to rise to 77,000 b/d in 2026-27, up by around 28pc from 60,000 b/d in 2021-22. But the 2026-27 demand figure remains lower than the pre-pandemic level of 89,000 b/d in 2019. Meti expects LPG demand, excluding its use for power generation, to increase over the next five years at an average growth rate of 0.8pc/yr from 2021-22 to 2026-27. Meti sees LPG use in 2026-27 rising to 13.1mn t, up by 4.3pc from the 2021-22 demand estimate of 12.6mn t. LPG use in the industry and petrochemical sectors could increase towards 2026-27 amid an economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic. Demand for the city gas additive may also firm on the back of rising imports of US LNG with lower calorific values. But household demand is expected to fall because of a declining population and increased fuel efficiency of LPG equipment. Weaker household use of LPG could outweigh rebounding commercial demand. Meti also sees autogas demand declining with a continued fall in taxis on the road.","['<p class=""lead"">Japanese oil product demand is forecast to decline by an average 1.5pc/yr over the next five years, with the country\'s 2050 carbon-neutral target accelerating electrification and decarbonisation efforts.</p>', ""<p>Japan's economy, trade and industry ministry (Meti) predicts that overall domestic oil product consumption will drop to 2.44mn b/d in the April 2026-March 2027 fiscal year, down by 7.1pc from an estimated 2.6mn b/d in 2021-22.

Opec mulls removing IEA as secondary source: Correction,31 March 2022,By Nader Itayim,"Corrects to clarify the Opec+ has removed the IEA Opec+ has removed Paris-based energy watchdog the IEA from the panel of ""official"" secondary sources that monitor the group's monthly crude production. The group's Joint Technical Committee (JTC) yesterday made the decision based on what one source familiar with the thinking said was unreliable data. ""The reason [for the change] is that the IEA have compromised their technical analysis to fit their narrative,"" the source said. ""This is evident when observing the frequent changes in their recent reports and how far they deviate from the other respected agencies."" One such instance came in February when the agency made significant revisions to its current and historic oil demand figures, the source said, weeks after highlighting what it saw as ""a growing discrepancy between observes and calculated stock changes."" A second source pointed to several moments ""over the past two years"" that have eroded the Opec+ group's trust in the IEA's numbers. The IEA, for its part, has been critical of Opec+ recently, saying it is not doing enough to help tackle high energy prices. Earlier this month IEA executive director Fatih Birol described the group's decision to stick with a 400,000 b/d increase in its April crude quota as ""disappointing"". Opec+ has replaced the IEA as a secondary source with consultancies Wood Mackenzie and Rystad Energy, which join Argus, the US' EIA, S&amp;P Global Platts, IHS Markit and Energy Intelligence. The Opec+ group calculates the production quota compliance of individual members by averaging the output estimates of the independent sources. Sources say that Opec, which has long used secondary sources to assess its monthly production, is likely to follow suit by removing the IEA, but this is yet to be confirmed. Opec+ has not yet veered from the roadmap it agreed in July last year, opting to limit its production quota increases to 400,000 b/d each month and resisting pressure from outside the group for bigger hikes. Opec+ ministers have repeatedly defended the policy, arguing that high oil prices are being underpinned by geopolitical sentiment rather than market fundamentals, and that underinvestment and dwindling capacity are hampering the coalition's ability to raise output. Ministers are likely to once again stick to the script when they meet later today to discuss production policy for May, although the monthly increase will be larger at 432,000 b/d as five countries in the group enjoy an upward revision to their base production levels, on which their quotas and compliance levels are determined.

European Commission raids German gas firms,31 March 2022,By Dafydd ab Iago,"The European Commission today said its investigators, along with German competition officials, carried out ""unannounced inspections"" at ""several companies"" in Germany active in gas supply, transmission and storage. Officials had declined to comment on whether the 29 March investigations are linked to an investigation into possible anti-competitive behaviour by Russian-state controlled Gazprom.

IEA hits back after its data are ditched by Opec+,31 March 2022,By Nader Itayim,"OECD energy watchdog the IEA has mounted a staunch defence of its data and analysis, after Opec and its non-Opec allies decided they would no longer use its numbers to calculate compliance with members' quotas under the Opec+ production restraint deal. ""The IEA notes the reports that Opec+ plans to no longer use the IEA's monthly Oil Market Report, a key reference for fundamental data and analysis, as a secondary source,"" the Paris-based group said today. ""IEA data and analysis remain available to all those seeking rigorous and objective market information."" The IEA said it would make its monthly Opec+ production survey publicly available ""to support transparency."" The statement comes one day after the Opec+ group's Joint Technical Committee (JTC) decided to remove, with immediate effect, the IEA from the panel of 'official' secondary sources that monitor the group's monthly crude production. The Opec secretariat has yet to officially comment on the move. A source familiar with the thinking said the change was made because of growing doubts within Opec+ of the reliability of the agency's data. ""The reason [for the change] is that the IEA have compromised their technical analysis to fit their narrative,"" the source said. ""This is evident when observing the frequent changes in their recent reports and how far they deviate from the other respected agencies."" A second source pointed to several moments ""over the past two years"" that have eroded the Opec+ group's trust in IEA, and a third said the group is uncomfortable with the ""political position"" the IEA has been taking in its reporting. The IEA, for its part, has been critical of Opec+ in recent months, saying it is not doing enough to help tackle high energy prices. Earlier this month IEA executive director Fatih Birol described the group's decision to stick with a 400,000 b/d increase in its April crude quota as ""disappointing"". Opec+ has replaced the IEA as a secondary source with consultancies Wood Mackenzie and Rystad Energy, sources said, which now join Argus Media, the US EIA, S&amp;P Global Platts, IHS Markit and Energy Intelligence.

"Opec+ sticks to script with 432,000 b/d May quota hike",31 March 2022,None,"The Opec+ coalition has agreed a 432,000 b/d increase in its combined crude output target for May, delegates said, resisting pressure from outside the group to raise production at a faster rate to help ease supply concerns stemming from the Russia-Ukraine conflict.  May's quota hike is slightly larger than the 400,000 b/d monthly increases implemented since last summer. This is because five members of the group will have higher baseline production levels from May. Today's Opec+ ministerial meeting comes against a backdrop of increased political pressure on the group to rethink its approach in light of the risk to Russian supply from international sanctions. Earlier this month, the IEA said at least 3mn b/d of Russian oil output could be forced offline as early as April. Leading trading firms Vitol, Mercuria, Trafigura and Gunvor project a similar-sized decline, of 2mn-3mn b/d.  The US has already banned Russian oil imports, and the UK has pledged to phase them out by the end of the year. More recently, Poland said it plans to stop importing Russian oil by the end of 2022 and called on other EU countries to follow suit. Opec+ ministers have repeatedly defended their output policy, arguing that the run-up in oil prices to over $100/bl is driven by geopolitics, not an actual shortage of oil. Since August last year, the group has stuck to a schedule of monthly increases of 400,000 b/d. An upward revision to the production baselines of Iraq, Kuwait, Russia, Saudi Arabia and the UAE means the monthly hike rises to 432,000 b/d in May.  Even if the group had decided to accelerate its production increases, its ability to do so would be limited. Several members are already struggling to meet their assigned quotas owing to dwindling capacity and underinvestment. Argus estimates that the gap between the coalition's target and its delivered output reached 890,000 b/d in February.  Saudi Arabia and the UAE hold the lion's share of remaining Opec+ spare capacity. Russia was running out of spare capacity even before sanctions threatened its supply — its March output target was just above its 10.3mn b/d of crude capacity, as estimated by Argus.  Russia is the third Opec+ member subject to sanctions, following Iran and Venezuela.

Q&A: Brazil congressman Ganime on the gas market,31 March 2022,By Flávia Pierry,"Brazilian lower house congressman Paulo Ganime (of the center-right New Party from Rio de Janeiro state) spoke with Argus about the country's new gas law, its reduced role for state-run oil and gas producer Petrobras and the early stages of the open gas market. Edited highlights follow. What are the current challenges for the gas sector in Brazil? The new law creates a more positive environment for investments, but it does little for gas production and demand. The new gas law paves the way for new consumers to be reached, in more volume and consequently at lower prices, but it needs regulation on the federal and state levels. Also, much depends on the resolution of some legal issues that are now causing uncertainty for investors.  Is the release of regulations from oil and gas regulator ANP and the states taking longer than expected?  It is easy to criticize. But the gas law was debated in Congress for years until it was ready and now we cannot blame ANP for the delay. There is an expectation it can advance faster, though, because this is the kind of subject that if you do not approve rules today, the law that was already approvedcannot be retracted. And the gas the producers reinject at the wells now due to commercial decisions, or lack of infrastructure to transport the gas, means time wasted. The gas could be reaching consumers now and we are not profiting from this energy.  Are the high rates of natural gas being reinjected into wells posing a problem?  Before thinking of intervening in the market, we must provide conditions for the producer to deliver the gas to the consumer. The government must provide the conditions. This comes with the law and regulations. And we must stimulate demand for gas. When there is demand, I am sure companies will prefer to sell gas rather than reinject.  Is a lack of pipelines a problem in Brazil?  There is spare capacity in some pipelines, but also some areas with unfulfilled demand that need pipelines reaching them. The gas law also addresses that. It is possible to have private investment in the midstream and reduce the need for state intervention. But on the other hand, Brazil needs economic development policies, policies that develop gas demand.  For instance, in my state, Rio de Janeiro, where we have an abundance of gas — we already have thermal power plants that consume the gas to justify pipeline investments, and this is a starting point. But we could have policies to attract industries in the ceramics, fertilizer and chemical industries, that need and consume gas. This would justify investment in pipelines, in processing units, and result in gas being supplied and consumed.  We currently have a debate in Brazil over whether the country needs more refining capacity. I believe we do, but there are units with idle capacity. And this happens because Petrobras is not interested in increasing fuel supply to the market, as that would lower prices. When we have competition, if Petrobras does not increase its fuel production, other players will. It is not just about the capacity to refine, but also about market concentration; and when it happens, prices go up.  What is the current situation of the gas market in the states? It is pointless to remove Petrobras and allow one private company to fill its space. The competition watchdog Cade must have a technical approach to the topic, neutral, especially in a moment of transition. If our aim is to attract investments, concentration (at the distribution level) is destructive. If we want to generate competition, one must forbid vertical integration.  Besides that, we must advance in regulations, having state regulatory agencies with competent technicians, not filled according to political interests. Making the role of each agency clear is necessary. For instance, there is a clash in São Paulo state about a pipeline classification, and this can take a huge toll.  On a national level, the concern is that private interests may prevail over the needs of the population, creating market distortions, which was the opposite of the aim we had with the new gas law. This is an important task, otherwise the work we did approving the gas law will not generate its desired effect or might even be reversed.

Petrobras warns new management may ditch price policy,31 March 2022,By Nathan Walters,"Political meddling in Petrobras' fuel pricing policy is one of the many risks that could adversely affect the Brazilian state-controlled company's performance, according to a recent company filing with US Securities and Exchange Commission. ""A new management team or board of directors may propose changes to our pricing policies, including a decision that such policies may not seek for alignment with international price parity,"" Petrobras said in the filing. In flagging the risk, the company referred to repeated statements from President Jair Bolsonaro urging a modification of the company's market-based pricing. The warning comes just days after Bolsonaro decided to replace outgoing chief executive Joaquim Silva e Luna with seasoned technocrat Adriano Pires — the second chief executive change in a little over a year — and just weeks before a shareholder meeting will put Rodolfo Landim, a controversial Rio businessman and oil industry veteran, in the chairman's seat.  The changes, just months before presidential elections in October, have raised concerns that Bolsonaro could meddle in the firm's decision making to tame spiraling inflation, which is weighing on his re-election bid.  Since 2016, Petrobras' market-based fuel pricing policy has been guided by the import price parity principle that seeks to align domestic commodity prices with the value of the same imported commodities. Petrobras' adherence to the policy, which attempts to avoid the transfer of global price volatility and exchange rate fluctuations caused by exceptional external issues, has often been criticized, but a clear change in strategy could disrupt fuel imports and sink the company's plans to sell seven refineries.  ""In the future, there may be periods during which our product prices will not be at parity with international product prices. Actions and legislation imposed by the Brazilian government, as our controlling shareholder, could affect these pricing decisions,"" the company said in the SEC filing.  Analysts do not expect Pires to make significant changes to the company's pricing policy, but the pro-market consultant has yet to provide insight into the strategy he will pursue as head of the firm. The future chief executive's nomination is subject to the approval of Petrobras' personnel committee and shareholder approval at the next meeting scheduled for 13 April.

Georgia 'needs direct EU link',31 March 2022,By Chloe Jardine,"Georgia must accelerate the construction of a planned power line to Romania to give the country a direct link to the EU power system as soon as possible, Tbilisi-based hydropower developer Energy Solutions says.  As Georgia gradually implements EU energy market rules, the country increases the ""regulatory gap"" with its direct neighbours, notably Russia and Azerbaijan, Energy Solutions managing director Giorgi Abramishvili said. Import capacity from Russia to Georgia is 700MW, which may not sound like much, Abramashvili said, but ""is enough to destroy the market"". Georgia's power exchange Genex plans to launch the country's day-ahead and balancing market on 1 September 2022, following a series of delays. A planned 1GW subsea cable through the Black Sea linking Jvaria and Anaklia in Georgia with Constanta in Romania is not expected to be built before 2030. The feasibility study is due to start soon and will provide more clarity on whether there is a ""very small"" chance for the power link to be completed before 2030, said the head of the energy policy department of the ministry of economy, Tornike Kazarashvili. Abramashvili, who is also executive director of the Georgian Renewable Energy Development Association (Greda), said that there is a risk that power exporters drive down wholesale market prices by bidding with power plants that have been written off. This could thwart investments in the new renewable capacity that Georgia needs, Abramishvili said.  Gas-fired power plants in Georgia will not set the price as in Europe, given their relatively low marginal costs — as a transit country of the South Caucasus Pipeline, Georgia has special drawing rights on Azeri gas. The regulated price for power plants excluding value-added tax was recently set at $9.50/MWh. Georgia is the only member or contracting party of EU-led regulatory body the Energy Community (EC) that has no direct links to an EU member state. Regulatory body GNERC commissioner Maia Melikidze admits that some of Georgia's direct neighbours have ""different agendas and systems"", but she stresses the ""reliability"" of Turkey and its higher-priced market, with which Georgia is linked through a 700MW power line. Melikidze says that Georgia's main concern is the growing gap between its consumption and generation levels. The country has been a net importer since 2017, with annual consumption growing by at least 5pc.  Potential investors in Georgian renewable power have in the past few years been in a regulatory vacuum that is expected to end once the market is launched. The new support system, to replace the state-controlled power-purchase agreement (PPA) system abolished three years ago, will be linked to the market price, in the form of a feed-in-premium (FiP) of US$15/MWh.  Tbilisi-based solar photovoltaic (PV) company Helios Energy Georgia managing director Tornike Darjania said the premium is much too low, as an initial market price could well hover around $30/MWh.  Energy consultant Walter Boltz, a former chairman of Austrian regulator E-Control, suggests that an ""effective"" supervisory body comparable to Remit in the EU should be introduced in Georgia, and pricing on the electricity exchange could initially be limited to a range of, for instance, €35-120/MWh. Boltz also suggests supporting renewable investments through a contracts for difference scheme, which would provide investment security.  Georgia has 4.5GW of total installed power capacity, with hydro accounting for 3.3GW. Thermal units — mostly gas-fired — account for around 1.1GW. The country has one 21MW wind farm and 20MW of installed PV capacity. Georgia will have 10.4GW of installed capacity in 2031, including 686MW of wind capacity and 260MW of solar power, according to the country's latest grid development plan.

BASF warns of output cuts if gas supply halved,31 March 2022,By Eoin Hughes,"German chemicals company BASF has warned of an effect on its operations from any cuts to gas supply, saying it will halt production at its Ludwigshafen complex if it cannot meet half of its current demand. The warning followed Germany's activation yesterday of its emergency gas plan after Russia said it may require payment in roubles for future supply. G7 countries including Germany have rejected paying for gas in roubles, and German economy minister Robert Habeck has said there are no supply bottlenecks. ""The chemical industry supplies the base products for almost all manufacturing industries,"" BASF told Argus Media. ""Therefore, severe bottlenecks in gas supply and resulting impairments or shutdowns in BASF's production can be expected to lead to serious interruptions in many value chains of our downstream customers.""  It said ""almost all industries"" would be affected, including agriculture, food, automotive, cosmetics/hygiene, construction, packaging, pharmaceuticals and electronics. As an example, BASF pointed out Ludwigshafen makes substances used in medical products like disinfectant and protective clothing that are needed for the Covid-19 pandemic. The complex also makes products used for items like food packaging and hygiene products. BASF said its European gas purchasing is used 60pc to generate energy for production and 40pc as a raw material in that production, so any shortage would hit hard. It cited ammonia as an example of a process that uses gas. Ammonia, in turn, is used to make fertilizer, availability of which would be cut if BASF reduces ammonia output. This could shrink yields in food production. These markets have already felt the affects of the Ukraine conflict, as Russia is a major exporter of ammonia and fertilizers. ""A reduction in gas supplies in Germany would further exacerbate the shortage of fertilizers worldwide, reduce food production and cause prices for basic foodstuffs to rise further,"" BASF said. Another process that uses gas is acetylene, which is then used as a building block for other products including, BASF said, ""the automotive, pharmaceutical, construction, consumer goods and textile industries.""","['<p class=""lead"">German chemicals company BASF has warned of an effect on its operations from any cuts to gas supply, saying it will halt production at its Ludwigshafen complex if it cannot meet half of its current demand.</p>', '<p>The warning followed Germany\'s activation yesterday of <a href=""https://direct.argusmedia.com/newsandanalysis/article/2316821"">its emergency gas plan</a> after Russia said it may require payment in roubles <a href=""https://direct.argusmedia.com/newsandanalysis/article/2316932"">for future supply</a>.

US to draw down 180mn bl from SPR: Update,31 March 2022,By Chris Knight,"Adds remarks from Biden, details on IEA release and SPR transportation constraints. President Joe Biden today ordered the drawdown of 1mn b/d of crude from the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) over six months in hopes of reducing gasoline prices until domestic production has time to ramp up. The largest-ever global release of crude reserves will be a ""war time bridge"" to shore up global supplies until an anticipated 1mn b/d increase in US oil production is reached later this year, a senior administration official said. Biden said releasing the crude is meant to counter an energy price spike connected to Russian president Vladimir Putin's decision to place troops in Ukraine. ""Our prices are rising because of Putin's action,"" Biden said. ""There is not enough supply. And the bottom line is if we want lower gas prices, we need to have more oil supply right now."" The US will soon issue a notice soliciting bids for the emergency sales, which will make crude available starting in May. Nymex WTI crude futures for delivery over the six months starting in May were averaging near $99/bl as of 1 pm ET, although the SPR's blended crude stream typically sells at a discount. The revenue from the upcoming sale will pay for refilling the SPR once emergency conditions end, which the White House says should give producers an added signal to step up output now. The US is seeking to coordinate its SPR release with other countries, which should bring drawdowns from global strategic reserves to ""well in excess"" of the 1mn b/d portion provided by the US, a senior administration official said. Biden estimated other countries will release ""as high as somewhere between 30mn-50mn bl."" The International Energy Agency (IEA) will hold an emergency ministerial meeting tomorrow. The US holds the largest strategic oil reserves in the world, with 568mn of crude in the SPR as of last week. Today's 180mn bl crude drawdown will come on top of two other recent withdrawals. Earlier this month, Biden ordered the emergency sale of 30mn bl of crude from the SPR, representing half of a 60mn drawdown organized by the IEA. Biden separately started a program in November offering long-term loans of 21.7mn bl of SPR crude and the outright sale of 18mn bl. The SPR holds a mix 56pc sour crude and 44pc sweet crude in salt caverns spread across four facilities in Texas and Louisiana that are served by interstate pipelines that connect to nearby refineries and marine terminals. The SPR has a maximum drawdown capability of 4.4mn b/d, but weekly withdrawals have never exceeded 864,000 b/d since withdrawals started in 1985, according to federal data.  Biden's push for sustained withdrawals from the SPR of 1mn b/d over six months risks hitting bottlenecks of surrounding infrastructure. The SPR's ability to add incremental crude to the market has declined over the last decade, as the shale oil boom increased utilization of nearby pipelines and marine terminals along the US Gulf coast, a 2016 review by the US Energy Department found. SPR sale bidders are customarily responsible for arranging transportation. Getting the 1mn b/d of SPR crude to other US markets could run into other limits. The administration said it plans to ""promptly process"" requests for waivers from Jones Act shipping restrictions to transport crude from the SPR to other US ports, if there are shortages of qualified US-flagged tankers to carry crude to market, a senior administration official said. The administration has set a goal of providing responses to waiver requests within two days. Biden said he was pairing the SPR release with a plan to put more pressure on domestic producers to increase output. He will call on the US Congress to adopt a ""use it or lose it"" policy for the 9,000 unused but approved drilling permits the oil and gas industry already holds on federal onshore leases, based on concerns from the administration that companies are hoarding federal leases without producing.  ""Congress should make companies pay fees on wells on federal leases they have not used in years, and acres of public land they are holding without production,"" Biden said. Biden also intends to urge Congress to speed up the transition to clean energy by providing more funding, the White House said, in a likely reference to $500bn for clean energy and climate change programs in Biden's stalled Build Back Better Act. Biden will also sign a directive authorizing the use of powers in the Korean War-era Defense Production Act to increase domestic production of critical minerals used in large-capacity batteries and electric vehicles. The SPR release could go some way toward compensating for a potential drop in Russian exports because of sanctions imposed following the outbreak of the conflict in Ukraine. Around 2mn-3mn b/d of Russian oil could be lost as a result of fallout from the conflict, according to forecasts from the heads of trading companies Trafigura, Vitol and Gunvor. US retail regular grade gasoline prices averaged $4.23/USG in the week ended on 28 March, just 8¢/USG shy of the all-time record set two weeks before. High fuel prices have been a primary contributor to inflation rates hitting a 40-year high and growing frustration among voters with Biden's job performance. Oil industry officials have argued Biden should focus efforts on increasing domestic output, rather than providing a short-term release of crude from strategic stocks. ""If the administration really wants to be strategic here, they will promote the production of oil and gas in the US through development on federal lands and waters,"" American Petroleum Institute regulatory affairs senior vice president Frank Macchiarola said in a televised interview.","['<p><i>Adds remarks from Biden, details on IEA release and SPR transportation constraints.</i></p>', '<p class=""lead"">President Joe Biden today ordered the drawdown of 1mn b/d of crude from the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) over six months in hopes of reducing gasoline prices until domestic production has time to ramp up.</p>', '<p>The largest-ever global release of crude reserves will be a ""war time bridge"" to shore up global supplies until an anticipated 1mn b/d increase in US oil production is reached later this year, a senior administration official said.

Maine transmission challenges land on docket,31 March 2022,By Patrick Zemanek,"Maine's highest court will soon consider the future of a controversial transmission project to bring Canadian hydropower into the ISO-New England grid. The Maine Supreme Judicial Court in its upcoming session will consider the constitutionality of the November ballot initiative, through which state residents voted to block construction of the New England Clean Energy Connect (NECEC) project being developed by utility Avangrid, a subsidiary of Spanish utility Iberdrola.  The court is next scheduled to convene 9-12 May, and NECEC said it expects a decision from the court ""around a month"" after the oral arguments. That decision could determine whether the project lives or dies. The company yesterday told the court the transmission line would not only benefit state, regional and national clean energy goals, but also ratepayers. ""The opponents of this project, including fossil fuel generators and certain environmental NGOs, continue to be the 'party of no' , dismissing climate change and stoking NIMBY and narrow-minded fear mongering in favor of the status quo which leaves Mainers relying on fossil fuels,"" Avangrid general counsel Scott Mahoney said. The Maine Bureau of Parks and Lands and the state's Public Utilities Commission, both named as defendants in the case, declined to comment. The issue at hand stems from a November ballot referendum that asked voters in Maine if they wished to ban ""high-impact transmission lines in the Upper Kennebec area,"" which the NECEC line would traverse. The referendum language also required that the legislature approve all such projects by a two-thirds vote, retroactive to 2014, when state regulators originally leased public lands to NECEC. Avangrid sued the state on 3 November, saying the referendum was invalid, foremost because it would retroactively bar construction on a project that was permitted and on which ""substantial"" work has already begun.  Later that month, Avangrid paused development on NECEC while the legal battle played out. The utility has spent just shy of $450mn on the line to date, granting it ""vested rights"" that entitle it to complete the project under the law when it was approved, Avangrid said in its court filing. But the state in its own filing yesterday said that Avangrid began construction before the project was fully permitted. Moreover, the company was aware of the campaign to stop the project via referendum and chose to push ahead. ""Its commencement of construction despite these significant legal obstacles to completion of the project was a calculated risk that does not entitle NECEC to claim vested rights under any legal theory,"" Maine assistant attorney general Jonathan Bolton said. The office of the attorney general declined additional comment. The constitutionality of the project is not the only unresolved issue surrounding the transmission line. The state Board of Environmental Protection (BEP) on 17-18 May will consider four appeals to its approval of NECEC, including challenges from the Natural Resources Council of Maine (NRCM) and Florida-based utility NextEra Energy.  The challenges broadly argue that the Maine Department of Environmental Protection erred when it approved NECEC in 2020 for reasons that include failing to consider alternatives to the project's construction plans, the project's impact on the environment and whether the decision to approve the project rests not with the department, but the BEP. If the board decides there is ""credible conflicting technical information"" about the approval or otherwise feels its decision would benefit from additional discussions, it will schedule an additional hearing. NextEra declined to comment.

Hampton Roads coal exports reach 3-year high,31 March 2022,By Abby Caplan,"Coal exports from Hampton Roads, Virginia, rose in February to the highest level in three years, reflecting strong demand for US coal amid tight international supply. The three terminals at the port loaded about 2.95mn short tons (2.68mn metric tonnes) of coal for export during the month, according to data collected by the Virginia Maritime Association. The last time shipments were higher was in March 2019 when 3.26mn st were exported. Exports were 49pc higher last month than they had been a year earlier, when demand was still recovering from measures to control the spread of Covid-19. Export and domestic coal shipments dropped in 2020 as global lockdowns limited coal demand. February loadings were also 29pc above January 2022 volumes.  Coal export loadings rose at all three of Hampton Roads' coal terminals from a year earlier. The largest year-on-year increase occurred at Kinder Morgan's Pier IX operation. The terminal loaded 711,563st last month, more than double the 275,995st handled in February 2021. Volume also rose by 30pc compared with the prior month. Dominion Terminal Associates (DTA), co-owned by Arch Resources and Alpha Metallurgical Resources, loaded 1.18mn st of coal for export last month, up by 29pc compared with February 2021. DTA had handled 919,074st in the year-earlier month. Exports increased by 14pc compared with January. Shipments out of Norfolk Southern's Lamberts Point terminal rose to 1.06mn st last month, up compared with 788,205st in the same period of 2021.

Japan’s major city gas firms spin off pipeline business,01 April 2022,By Reina Maeda,"Japan's major gas retailers Tokyo Gas, Osaka Gas and Toho Gas have spun off their pipeline service business from production and sales operations in the final stage of liberalisation of the country's retail city gas market.  Subsidiaries Tokyo Gas Network, Osaka Gas Network and Toho Gas Network took over the firms' pipeline service operations on 1 April. Other small city gas distributors are not required to spin off their pipeline service business. But they should continue to separate the accounting of their pipeline service business from that of other operations.  The legal separation of pipeline service from gas production and sales operations is aimed at encouraging competition in the retail city gas market, which was liberalised in April 2017. Neutralising pipeline operations helps create a competitive environment and fair conditions to encourage new businesses to enter the city gas sector, Japan's trade and industry ministry (Meti) said. Japan has been gradually deregulating its city gas sector since 1995, although progress lags that of the electricity market that was deregulated in 2016. The country's city gas sales rose by 4.1pc on the year to 37.7bn m³ in 2021, according to data from Meti. But demand for main city gas feedstock LNG dropped by 5.1pc from a year earlier to 24.2mn t in 2021, as domestic gas retailers have been increasing purchases of lean LNG, which has a lower calorific value compared to conventional gas and so requires more LPG. Use of LPG, a heat additive for city gas, increased by 20pc on the year to 1.2mn t in 2021.","['<p class=""lead"">Japan\'s major gas retailers Tokyo Gas, Osaka Gas and Toho Gas have spun off their pipeline service business from production and sales operations in the final stage of liberalisation of the country\'s retail city gas market. </p>', ""<p>Subsidiaries Tokyo Gas Network, Osaka Gas Network and Toho Gas Network took over the firms' pipeline service operations on 1 April.

IEA to hold extraordinary oil market meeting on 1 April,31 March 2022,By Ruxandra Iordache,"IEA member countries will hold an extraordinary meeting on 1 April to discuss a potential response to the recent volatility in oil markets. ""Tomorrow, IEA governments are coming together in an extraordinary meeting,"" IEA executive director Fatih Birol said on a New York Times energy podcast. ""We are going to discuss what kind of steps we can take in order to provide stability to the oil markets."" Birol did not specify whether a further release of oil from strategic stocks might be on the table. The IEA announced at the start of March that it would co-ordinate a release of over 60mn bl of oil from members' strategic stocks, around half of it from the US, in only its fourth ever drawdown since its foundation in 1974. The US announced today that it intends to release an additional 180mn bl of crude from its Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) over the next six months, in a bid to soften gasoline prices at the pump until domestic oil production increases. President Joe Biden said it is his ""guess"" that an extra 30mn-50mn bl will also be released from stocks by US allies, although he did not specify which countries nor did he give a timeframe.  Washington's SPR release announcement coincides with the Opec+ coalition agreeing to increase its collective crude production target by 432,000 b/d in May, in line with its agreed schedule. Birol has recently been critical that Opec+ has not committed to bigger increases to help dampen oil prices, but today he took a more conciliatory tone. ""It is of course up to the Opec countries and Russia what kind of action they will take,"" he said. Opec+ ministers insist that the prevailing price rally above $100/bl is in response to geopolitics, rather than market fundamentals. One Opec+ delegate told Argus that the group would have stuck to its output policy for May regardless of the US decision to release more crude from storage. Another said the new US SPR drawdown will have no impact in the short term, and that it remains to be seen whether all the countries that pledged strategic stock releases earlier this month carry them out. A third delegate questioned whether there will be sufficient demand for all the US SPR crude.

Singapore ship owners grapple with HSFO contamination,01 April 2022,"By Sammy Six, Andrew Khaw and Sarah Giam","Several vessels that have bunkered high-sulphur fuel oil (HSFO) in Singapore are now experiencing mechanical issues because of contaminated fuel, according to several fuel testing agencies. Organic chloride compound, a substance which may cause excessive sludging, was found on 15 March in several samples of HSFO delivered earlier that month, according to testing agency Maritec. Several dozen vessels have since experienced power outages as a result, owing to a loss of power and propulsion, testing agency Veritas Petroleum Services said. Very-low sulphur fuel oil (VLSFO) bunkers have also suffered from quality issues, such as low flashpoints, in recent weeks, which has resulted in some debunkering operations in the region. The contaminated HSFO is heard to have originated from only a couple of suppliers.  But it is too early to say if any switching to LSFO will occur, with switching possibly unlikely given high LSFO prices as well, traders said. Outright Singapore 0.5pc sulphur marine fuel prices rose to record highs of $1,009.75/t on 9 March. They have since fallen slightly, but remain supported at $828.75/t yesterday.  ""The lack of availabilities and high flat price can lead both suppliers and buyers to compromise on quality,"" said one local bunker trader.  The premium of HSFO bunkers over HSFO cargoes in Singapore has risen as a result, averaging $15.50/t in March and $25.75/t yesterday, compared to a more typical $10/t, according to Argus data. Large vessels which are fitted with scrubbers — very large crude carriers (VLCC), very large ore carriers (VLOC), Capesize, and Suezmax vessels — are the ships that will continue to be most affected by the contaminated HSFO. Shipowners with vessels affected by the contaminated fuel have two options, depending on the severity of the contamination and the effect the contamination has had on the vessel's engine. One option is to return to Singapore to debunker and obtain a new supply of HSFO, while the other is to proceed with their voyage and be compensated financially. How claims proceed would also be dependent on which version of ISO8217 is used, if it is based on 2005, 2010, or 2017. Clause 5 for each of these revisions differ, with 2005 being the most rigid in its writing. For example, in 2005, it states that bunkers ""shall not include incorporation of small amounts of additives"", while in 2010, the term ""small amounts"" was removed. A temporary measure would be to perform more lab tests, but these tests can take 2-3 days, which would eat into shipowners' margins. Argus' TCE rates for a scrubber-fitted Capesize vessel on the Tubarao to Qingdao route was at $20,554/d on 31 March, with rates for a scrubber-fitted Suezmax vessel from Ras Tanura to Qingdao at $14,164/d. The contamination of HSFO supplies at Singapore, along with likely supply losses from Russia and utility demand picking up in south Asia, have been driving up 180cst HSFO margins, traders said. Singapore 180cst HSFO margins against Dubai crude values shot up to over one-year highs of -$0.08/bl on 11 March, according to Argus' assessments. They also entered positive territory today at $0.83/bl for the first time since $0.05/bl on 2 November 2020.  Pakistan's state-owned marketer PSO has bought 260,000t of HSFO for April-delivery, all priced against 180cst HSFO Mideast Gulf spot assessments on a cfr basis. These are its first purchases since a 65,000t HSFO cargo for first-half November delivery last year, possibly as utility demand for cooling — which typically peaks during summer — picks up. HSFO imports into Bangladesh also reached a five-month high of 263,000t (54,700 b/d) last month, according to Vortexa data. Meanwhile, leaner low-viscosity fuel oil exports from the US are also tightening low-viscosity molecules supply in markets, further supporting margins. The viscosity of such cargoes could range from 25-100cst, according to market participants.  Just 272,500t of HSFO is expected to depart the US next month, lower than the average 710,900 t/month exports last year, according to Vortexa data. This could be partially because of the loss of Russia fuel oil imports to the US, amid the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict.

One option is to return to Singapore to debunker and obtain a new supply of HSFO, while the other is to proceed with their voyage and be compensated financially.</p>"", '<p>How claims proceed would also be dependent on which version of ISO8217 is used, if it is based on 2005, 2010, or 2017. Clause 5 for each of these revisions differ, with 2005 being the most rigid in its writing. For example, in 2005, it states that bunkers ""shall not include incorporation of small amounts of additives"", while in 2010, the term ""small amounts"" was removed.</p>', ""<p>A temporary measure would be to perform more lab tests, but these tests can take 2-3 days, which would eat into shipowners' margins. <i>Argus</i>' TCE rates for a scrubber-fitted Capesize vessel on the Tubarao to Qingdao route was at $20,554/d on 31 March, with rates for a scrubber-fitted Suezmax vessel from Ras Tanura to Qingdao at $14,164/d.</p>"", ""<p>The contamination of HSFO supplies at Singapore, along with likely supply losses from Russia and utility demand picking up in south Asia, have been driving up 180cst HSFO margins, traders said.

Citgo refinery runs highest since 2019,01 April 2022,By Dylan Chase ,"Citgo ran its US refineries at their highest levels in two years in the fourth quarter of 2021, helping spur a quarterly profit for the US refining subsidiary of Venezuelan national oil company PdV.

East Asian importers buy record volumes of Indian wheat,01 April 2022,By Bilal Muftuoglu,"Key importers in east Asia have stepped up their Indian wheat purchases this year, with record volumes scheduled to be shipped to South Korea and Vietnam in early April, following India's bumper harvest and declining wheat and corn arrivals to the region from other parts of the world. About 72,600t of wheat are scheduled to be shipped to Vietnam by the middle of next week from India's Kandla port. At the same time, combined volumes of South Korea-bound wheat cargoes between mid-March and the first week of April were seen at 270,000t, line-up data show. The Philippines, Yemen, Oman, the UAE, Qatar and Bangladesh — the primary buyer of Indian wheat — were also seen to receive cargoes from Kandla, as well as the port of Mundra, shipped between early March and April. India resumed its wheat exports to South Korea this year after a six-year break. Its combined shipments since the start of the country's wheat 2021-22 marketing year in April 2021 and January 2022 hit 131,400t. South Korea last imported large volumes of Indian wheat in 2013-14, when exports totalled 546,200t. Exports to Vietnam also picked up this year for the first since 2014-15, totalling 15,700t in April 2021-January 2022. With shipments to Vietnam previously peaking at 77,000t in 2013-14, currently scheduled cargoes would bring Vietnam's wheat receipts from India to a record. This comes as India's bumper harvest has boosted the country's exports to all-time highs in 2021-22. Shipments of wheat totalled 5.96mn t in April-January, up from 1.19mn t in the same period in 2020-21, including new east Asian markets such as Indonesia and the Philippines. Most east Asian buyers initially turned to India for feed wheat supply in a bid to replace reduced arrivals of corn from Brazil. But more recently, shipment disruptions from Ukraine and Russia, paired with logistical limits to wheat shipments from Australia prompted the region to turn to India for milling wheat as well. South Korea's corn imports fell to 7.34mn t from 7.87mn t in the first eight months of the country's 2021-22 marketing year (July 2021-June 2022), with receipts of Brazilian crop falling to just 741,000t from 2.4mn t a year earlier. At the same time, the country's wheat imports rose to 3.2mn t from 2.37mn t in July 2020-February 2021. South Korea's higher feed wheat purchases meant other producers of the crop also stepped up exports to the destination, with receipts from Bulgaria and Romania reaching new highs. But the recent decline in Argentinian corn prices, paired with expectations of record corn production in Brazil in the coming harvest, could bring east Asian buyers back to corn purchases. South Korea was heard to have booked an Argentinian cargo of corn this week at a 50-55¢/bu premium over the Chicago Board of Trade July corn futures contract for June shipment — equalling $380/t cfr — implying that the country's corn import prices reached parity with those of Indian wheat.","['<p class=""lead"">Key importers in east Asia have stepped up their Indian wheat purchases this year, with record volumes scheduled to be shipped to South Korea and Vietnam in early April, following India\'s bumper harvest and declining wheat and corn arrivals to the region from other parts of the world.</p>', ""<p>About 72,600t of wheat are scheduled to be shipped to Vietnam by the middle of next week from India's Kandla port.

"Vattenfall’s biomass, waste burn up in 2021",01 April 2022,None,"Swedish utility Vattenfall's power and heat generation from biomass and waste products rose year on year in 2021.  Electricity generation from biomass and waste rose to 500GWh in 2021 from 300GWh a year earlier, the firm said. Of this total, 200GWh was generated in Sweden and 300GWh in Germany.  Heat production from biomass, waste and peat also rose to 4.4TWh from 3.3TWh a year earlier. Of these, 3.4TWh was generated in Sweden and 1TWh in Germany.  More than half of the total amount (TWh) of waste and biomass fired in Vattenfall's combined heat and power (CHP) units and heat-only boilers is waste, including recycled wood waste, Vattenfall said.  Installed electricity capacity for biomass, peat and waste fell on the year, while installed capacity for heat increased, leading to an increase in production of heat generation in 2021.  Vattenfall revised its sourcing strategy for woody biomass in 2021 to use only domestically sourced, low-value by-products, it said. The firm's 41pc of biomass came from Sweden, 36pc from Germany, 12pc from Norway and 11pc from the rest of Europe over the period. All of the woody biomass for sale to third parties on the international market was certified by the Sustainable Biomass Programme, or the Forestry Stewardship Council, sourced from within the EU from mainly Baltic states.  Vattenfall invested 222mn Swedish krona (€21.6mn) less in biomass and waste products for firing in their CHP units and heat-only boilers in 2021 than in 2020, decreasing investments from SKr295mn to SKr73mn.  The company is pursuing projects in Diemen, the Netherlands, to either build a 100MW biomass-fired heat-only boiler or install a new 120MW e-boiler at the site. It is also considering solutions to accelerate its phase-out of natural gas in the Netherlands to be replaced with renewables.  In Germany, Vattenfall aims to phase out hard coal for heat generation at its 247MW CHP plant Moabit in the early second-half of the 2020s and the 878MW Reuter West plant in the late 2020s, which will be replaced ""likely"" by a combination of biomass, waste heat from its waste incineration operations in Berlin, hydrogen-ready natural gas, power-to-heat, large heat pumps and heat storage, it said.

Talos finalises Zama unitisation deal with Pemex,01 April 2022,None,"US producer Talos Energy has finalised the unitisation agreement for its shallow-water Zama discovery in Mexico following an operatorship dispute with state-owned Pemex. In 2017, Talos announced the Zama find of up to 950mn bl of recoverable oil equivalent in block 7, which neighbours Pemex acreage. But after more than two years of talks, the parties failed to agree and the energy ministry designated Pemex as operator in July last year. That decision was criticised for deterring investors, for the strain it will put on Pemex's stretched finances, and because of Pemex's lack of experience drilling a reservoir at Zama's depth. The block could produce up to 160,000 b/d of oil equivalent, Talos says, making it the largest exploration and production contract awarded since 2014's energy reforms.","['<p class=""lead"">US producer Talos Energy has finalised the unitisation agreement for its shallow-water Zama discovery in Mexico following an operatorship dispute with state-owned Pemex.

ANP appeals approval of Gaspetro sale to Compass,01 April 2022,By Flávia Pierry,"Brazilian oil and gas regulator ANP has appealed the antitrust agency Cade's decision that allowed the sale of Petrobras gas distribution subsidiary Gaspetro to gas trading company Compass.  In a 23 March decision, ANP's directors asked Cade's general superintendent to bring the Cade approval before a special jury at Cade. ANP's technical review of the transaction concluded the Gaspetro sale would be detrimental for the competition at the gas market in the country. This is not the first appeal on the case presented to Cade. Natural gas buyers and industry participants, represented by industry advocacy groups, have asked that the case be heard by a special jury at Cade. And Cade judge Lenisa Rodrigues Prado on 24 March referred the case to the Cade jury, saying that completing the transaction ""potentially transfers a near-to-monopolistic position to a new player — Compass and Cosan group,"" violating the agreement that Petrobras signed with the competition watchdog. Cade's general superintendent's decision allowing the sale admitted that it would lead to a concentration at the gas purchasing in the country, but it said that eventual competition problems could be solved by ANP through regulatory actions.  The request from ANP for the Cade jury to review the decision shows that ANP disagrees and does not believe that regulation will be able to protect competition.  A panel of Cade judges known as the board of counselors will now consider whether to impose remedies and limitations on the transaction. The committee in charge of Brazil's gas market liberalization, headed by the ministry of mines and energy, previously indicated that the purchase's approval may work against competition, putting around 60pc of all gas purchases in Brazil in Compass' hands. Gaspetro has shares in 18 natural gas distribution companies, is partnered with state governments as well as Japanese company Mitsui.","['<p class=""lead"">Brazilian oil and gas regulator ANP has appealed the antitrust agency Cade\'s decision that allowed the sale of Petrobras gas distribution subsidiary Gaspetro to gas trading company Compass. </p>', ""<p>In a 23 March decision, ANP's directors asked Cade's general superintendent to bring the Cade approval before a special jury at Cade.

Australia's Iluka approves rare earths refinery,04 April 2022,By Angus Macmillan,"Australian heavy minerals producer Iluka Resources' board of directors has approved a final investment decision to build an integrated rare earths refinery at Eneabba in Western Australia with funding support from the country's federal government. Construction of the project, which will be owned and operated by Iluka through a special purpose entity called RefineryCo, is expected to start in the second half of this year with first commercial production expected in 2025, the firm said. Iluka is a producer of zircon, ilmenite and rutile from operations in Australia and Sierra Leone. With capacity to produce 17,500 t/yr of total rare earth oxide (TREO) and 23,000 t/yr when all circuits are fully utilised, the capital cost of the refinery is projected at A$1bn-1.2bn ($750-900mn) with over A$1.2bn of funding coming from a loan and cost overrun facility from the government's Critical Minerals Facility and administered by Export Finance Australia. The refinery, which is in addition to screening and concentrating facilities already in operation, will focus on producing separated rare earth oxides such as neodymium, praseodymium, terbium and dysprosium for applications including electric vehicles, renewable energy, electronics and the defence and medical sectors. It will include roasting, leaching, purification, solvent extraction and product finishing facilities.  Initially fed from Iluka's own stocks at Eneabba, longer term feedstock will come from the firm's Wimmera deposit and from third-party sources increasing the processing rate to 55,000 t/yr. The stocks are expected to sustain nine years of production to 2033 with 12,400 t/yr of TREO production including 2,700 t/yr of neodymium-praseodymium (NdPr). Longer term output is anticipated of 5,500 t/yr of Nd/Pr, essential for permanent magnets used in EVs and wind turbines. Australia's resources minister Keith Pitt said the refinery will increase Australia's critical minerals capacity.

Japanese firms step up biomass power investments,04 April 2022,By Motoko Hasegawa,"Japanese firms are gearing up to increase their investments in biomass power generation projects to reduce the country's greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, in line with Japan's target to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.  Japanese utility Hokkaido Electric Power has decided to invest in a 50MW Tomato biomass power project at Tomakomai, on the northern Hokkaido island. The utility will buy a 20pc stake from Singapore-based fund Equis, leaving Equis with a 80pc share in the project. The companies plan to jointly develop the plant, which is designed to burn imported wood pellets and palm kernel shells, targeting for commissioning in April 2025. Electricity produced at the site will be sold to regional grid firm Hokkaido Electric Power Network at a fixed price for 20 years under the country's feed-in-tariff (FiT) scheme.  Fellow utility Hokuriku Electric Power has agreed to buy a 25pc share in a 112MW biomass power plant planned at Sendai port, in northeastern Miyagi prefecture, from Japanese trading firm Sumitomo. Gas retailer Tokyo Gas has also secured a 25pc stake in the project through its 100pc-owned subsidiary Prominet Power, reducing Sumitomo's shares to 50pc, of which 5pc is owned through its subsidiary Sumitomo Tohoku. The new plant is expected to start operations in October 2025, using imported wood pellets and domestically-supplied woody biomass as feedstock.  Three Japanese firms, including Mitsubishi Gas Chemical, SMFL Mirai Partners and Tokyo Energy and Systems, have joined the Abashiri biomass power project in Hokkaido, which is led by domestic upstream firm Japex. The project consists of two 9.9MW plants which will be fired by locally-supplied wood chips. The No.2 unit is expected to begin operations in August, followed by the No.3 unit in December.

Government-nominated Petrobras chairman bows out,04 April 2022,By Nathan Walters,"Brazilian oil industry veteran Rodolfo Landim has withdrawn from his government-backed nomination as the next chairman of state-controlled Petrobras just days before a 13 April shareholder vote.  ""Despite the size and importance of Petrobras for our country, and the enormous honor for me to hold this position … I decided to give up this nomination, concentrating all my time and dedication for the even greater strengthening of our Flamengo,"" Landim said in a 3 April note, referring to Rio de Janeiro's Flamengo football team for which he is president.  Landim, a 26-year Petrobras' veteran, was nominated by Brazil's mines and energy ministry in early March. Allegations of fraud connected to his role at Flamengo and potential conflicts of interest had raised questions of whether he could be confirmed in the role.  The mines and energy ministry has acknowledged Landim's decision but has yet to propose another candidate for the chairman role, which is being vacated by Brazilian navy admiral Eduardo Bacellar Leal Ferreira. Petrobras has not said whether the shareholder meeting will be rescheduled.  A vote confirming seasoned technocrat Adriano Pires as Petrobras' new chief executive is also on the agenda of next week's meeting. Picked by President Jair Bolsonaro to replace Joaquim Silva e Luna, Pires' candidacy still requires the approval of Petrobras' personnel committee.

Saudi Aramco lifts official May crude prices,04 April 2022,None,"Saudi Arabia's state-controlled Saudi Aramco has raised the official formula prices of all its May-loading crude exports.  The formula price for Arab Light, Arab Medium and Arab Heavy cargoes heading to Saudi Arabia's core Asia-Pacific market next month have been increased by $4.40/bl each compared with April, broadly in line with market expectations. Aramco had been expected to lift the May price for Arab Light exports to Asia-Pacific by $4-5/bl, depending on the impact of pandemic-related lockdowns on Chinese demand.  Some market sources had expected prices for Arab Medium and Arab Heavy to be raised by the same amount as Arab Light, although others anticipated a slightly smaller increase on the back of lower demand from India, where refiners have been buying heavily discounted medium sour Russian Urals. A sharp month-on-month rise in Saudi prices for Asian customers was widely anticipated given the potential for supply disruptions in Russia and the effect that might have on pushing up overall Asian demand for Mideast Gulf grades. The Saudi price hike also comes at a time of deteriorating arbitrage economics for eastbound cargoes from the Atlantic Basin. The front-month Brent-Dubai EFS — or Ice Brent's premium to Dubai swaps and a key barometer of eastbound arbitrage — averaged around $11.77/bl in March, compared with $6.37/bl in February. For its northwest European customers, Aramco has raised its May formula prices by $1.40-3.80/bl, while May prices for Mediterranean-bound exports have been increased by $0.60-3/bl on fob Ras Tanura terms and by $0.30-2.70/bl on fob Sidi Kerir terms. Market participants had expected Aramco to lift its prices for customers in the two regions. Many European buyers remain wary of purchasing Urals, which is increasing demand for alternative sour crudes.  North Sea crudes appear to have benefited the most from this reluctance to buy Urals, with several grades hitting record-high premiums to the North Sea Dated benchmark. There are signs of a pick-up in Baltic Urals cargoes arriving into the Mediterranean though, which may impact demand for Mideast Gulf crudes.  Aramco has raised the May formula prices for all its US-bound crude shipments by $2.20/bl against April cargoes.

India’s MCI recommends ADDs on LDPE imports: Update,01 April 2022,None,"Adds table The Indian Ministry of Commerce and Industry (MCI) is recommending anti-dumping duties (ADDs) on low density polyethylene (LDPE) imports from Saudi Arabia, Thailand and the US after completing an investigation. The duties vary and are specific to each producer. Duties on cargoes imported from Saudi Arabia range from $17.05-70.09/metric tonne. ADDs on imports from Thailand are $89.14-216.76/t. Imports from the US are subjected to ADDs of $74.27/t, except for cargoes from Westlake Chemical, which was exempted. LDPE imports from the UAE, Qatar, South Korea and Malaysia were exempted.  MCI began the anti-dumping investigation on 23 October 2020 following an application by India's Chemicals and Petrochemicals Manufacturers Association. Reactions to the MCI's findings have been mixed. Some Indian participants said the duties are justified to safeguard local markets. The announcement was also timely, with the deadline for the Bureau of Indian Standards PE quality control registrations approaching on 6 April. Participants said the combination of the two measures will ensure buyers receive quality imports without disrupting local PE markets. But other participants said the ADDs are not necessary, as local LDPE production is unable to keep up with demand, particularly for more specialized grades. Privately-owned Reliance Industries is India's only LDPE producer, with capacity of 505,000 t/yr. In 2021, India's net imports of LDPE were about 212,000t according to customs data compiled by Global Trade Tracker.  Recent inflationary pressures and higher feedstock prices have driven up LDPE import prices, making it more difficult for converters to maintain healthy margins. LDPE supplies to India have also been tightening as LDPE-ethyl vinyl acetate (EVA) swing producers worldwide forgo LDPE production for EVA production because of better netbacks on EVA. Participants are awaiting a formal announcement by India's central government on implementation of the duties. Some market participants expect the duties to be implemented in the next two-to-four weeks, as with previous ADDs on other commodities. The MCI has recommended the LDPE duties be imposed for five years from the date of implementation. Argus today assessed LDPE film at $1,710-1,730/t cfr India.

Emissions must peak by 2025 for 1.5°C: IPCC,04 April 2022,By Victoria Hatherick,"Global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions must peak before 2025 to keep global warming within Paris climate agreement limits, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) said today, entailing a rapid shift away from unabated fossil fuel use. Global GHG emissions must peak before 2025 at the latest in scenarios aiming to limit global warming to 1.5°C or 2°C compared with pre-industrial levels, the IPCC finds in its latest working group report on climate change mitigation. The 2015 Paris climate agreement aims to limit global warming to well below 2°C and preferably to 1.5°C. GHG emissions must be reduced by 43pc and methane by a third by 2030 to meet the 1.5°C target, while GHG emissions would need to be cut by a quarter by the end of the decade to meet 2°C, the IPCC says, with ""rapid and deep and in most cases immediate"" reductions needed across all sectors for both targets. In either case it is ""almost inevitable"" that the temperature threshold will be breached temporarily, but it could be brought back below the limit by 2100. The IPCC recognises that progress has been made in climate action. But policies implemented by the end of 2020 would still see emissions peak later than 2025, and lead to global warming of between 2.2-3.5°C by the end of the century, its report finds. They are also projected to yield higher GHG emissions than those implied by National Determined Contributions (NDCs), pointing to an ""implementation gap"", according to the report. A ""substantial reduction"" in fossil fuel use in the energy sector is needed to meet either the 1.5°C or 2°C target, alongside widespread electrification, deployment of alternative fuels such as hydrogen, and improvements to energy efficiency.  Limiting global warming to these levels will lead to the stranding of fossil fuel assets, as soon as this decade in the case of coal installations and towards the middle of the century for oil and gas. The economic impact could reach trillions of dollars. But the use of carbon capture and storage (CCS) would reduce the risk of stranded assets by prolonging the potential use of fossil-fuel installations. Without CCS, the world's coal-fired power plants would be forced to retire 23 years earlier than their expected lifetimes, and gas plants 17 years earlier, if the temperature targets to be met. New investments in coal-fired electricity without CCS are inconsistent with the targets, the report finds. Achieving net zero emissions in industry — which produces around a quarter of global emissions — is ""challenging but possible"", the IPCC said. This will require coordinated action throughout value chains, including new production processes using electrification, hydrogen and ""where necessary"" CCS. Efficiency, reuse and recycling can also minimise industry emissions. Established, new and rapidly growing cities all present options for emissions cuts, the IPCC finds, whether through the use of low-emission energy sources, zero-carbon buildings, or the electrification of transport. Electric vehicles using low-emission power ""offer the largest decarbonisation potential for land-based transport on a lifecycle basis"", the report concludes. Demand-side mitigation through lifestyle and behavioural changes represents ""untapped potential"" which could cut emissions by 40-70pc by mid-century, provided the necessary policy, infrastructure and technology are in place, the IPCC said. Land use mitigation can significantly reduce emissions, as well as removing and storing CO2 from the atmosphere. But this should not be used to compensate for delays in emissions cuts in other sectors, the IPCC warns. It expects the use of carbon removals to be ""unavoidable"" to address hard-to-abate residual emissions. But the scale and timing of their deployment will be subject to the progress of emissions cuts in individual sectors.","['<p class=""lead"">Global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions must peak before 2025 to keep global warming within Paris climate agreement limits, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) said today, entailing a rapid shift away from unabated fossil fuel use.</p>', '<p>Global GHG emissions must peak before 2025 at the latest in scenarios aiming to limit global warming to 1.5°C or 2°C compared with pre-industrial levels, the IPCC finds in its latest working group report on climate change mitigation.

Brazil gas market warming to spot trades,04 April 2022,By Flávia Pierry,"Relatively low demand in the first quarter has allowed participants in Brazil's nascent open natural gas market to begin pursuing spot gas trading opportunities. Argus heard from two participants that spot trades for small volumes have begun —transactions aimed at complementing contractual supply needs or even skirting higher-priced gas balancing needs at pipelines.  After a late-2021 sprint to tidy up the midstream sector to allow for the first contracts in the newly liberalized Brazilian gas market, spot trading emerged in late February and March. This is something new for a market dominated by state-run Petrobras until last December. ""The fears about the gas spot market are being dissolved,"" said one trader.  One spot transaction reported to Argus used national price references other than crude benchmarks, which were a foundation of the old Petrobras gas pricing model. The purchase was intended to make up for unmet contractual supply volumes because of field maintenance. Other transactions heard in the market were aimed at correcting pipeline obligations, such as the Gas of Use in System (GUS). In some cases, the GUS can be paid by gas carriers with extra gas injected into the pipelines.  The need for GUS is something new in the market because Petrobras, in its role as the sole supplier, did not separate the GUS cost from total transportation costs. Spot gas supply transactions are also being used to solve GUS demand for contracts that did not allow for spare volumes to cover GUS requirements.  Gas for balancing the system is also on the radar screen for gas traders. Carriers who fail to add gas at the pipelines to correct pressure or volume unbalances caused by their contract execution must pay the pipeline operator for emergency supplies. On the TAG pipeline — which runs from Rio de Janeiro to Ceará state — if one gas carrier fails to rebalance the grid, the operator will add gas and charge a base of the Asian LNG spot prices, as defined in international indexes.  Supplying balancing needs to avoid higher costs for the last resource balancing service is another opportunity traders are pursuing.  ""Looking for on-the-spot trading opportunities has been one of our mottoes,"" said another gas trader.  Oil and gas regulator ANP authorized 103 companies to be gas carriers as of 23 March. But only eight have signed transportation contracts on the TAG network: Petrorecôncavo, Potiguar, Equinor, SPE Miranga, Origem, Shell, Compass, Galp and Proquigel.  On the other two pipeline grids, only two companies signed contracts for transportation volumes: Petrobras is the sole carrier on the TBG network that brings gas from Bolivia to São Paulo state, and Petrobras and Galp are the only ones not counting local distribution companies on the NTS network, which moves gas into São Paulo, Minas Gerais and Rio de Janeiro states. Not having transportation capacity contracts can limit flexibility for signing spot contracts, but that can be solved by making agreements with other carriers with contracts. Transportation companies also started offering weekly opportunities for signing transportation capacity contracts for shorter periods, at the joint on-line platform POC. Fertilizer producer Proquigel has used the Brazilian gas market in innovative ways, finding a way to navigate around take-or-pay limitations in its gas contract supplied by Petrobras. Proquigel, a large gas consumer and the first to procure gas in a bilateral contract in the new market, agreed to sell gas to the local distribution company in Sergipe state, Sergás. The 50,000m³/d supply agreement run from February to April.","['<p class=""lead"">Relatively low demand in the first quarter has allowed participants in Brazil\'s nascent open natural gas market to begin pursuing spot gas trading opportunities.</p>', '<p>Argus heard from two participants that spot trades for small volumes have begun —transactions aimed at complementing contractual supply needs or even skirting higher-priced gas balancing needs at pipelines. </p>', '<p>After a late-2021 sprint to tidy up the midstream sector to allow for the first contracts in the newly liberalized Brazilian gas market, spot trading emerged in late February and March.

Panama Canal plans LNG carrier tariff hike,04 April 2022,None,"The Panama Canal Authority (ACP) has proposed a simplification of its LNG carrier tariffs that is set to lift transit costs and favour larger ships.  The authority has proposed a toll simplification that could come into force in 2023. The proposed new tariff structure for LNG carriers includes a single capacity-based rate for their entire capacity — lower than the current rates — as well as a fixed fee. The rate and the fixed fee change, depending on whether the vessel is a regular, super or neopanamax ship, although almost all LNG carriers only use the neopanamax locks. The roundtrip return ballast rate will also be removed under the proposed adjustment, while the normal ballast rate will be 90pc of the laden rate.  The ACP has historically based its LNG carrier transit tariffs on vessel capacity echelons, with one rate for the first 60,000m³ of capacity and incrementally lower rates for the next two 30,000m³ of capacity. The authority then applied a flat tariff in $/m³ for capacity exceeding the 120,000m³ threshold. The authority also applied a 10pc discount to empty carriers, and an even wider discount if the empty carriers were returning by the waterway having already transited while laden (see existing tariff structure table).  The proposed changes would increase the total cost for a 160,000m³ laden carrier in 2023 using the neopanamax locks to around $516,000, from $442,600 under the current tariff regime, and the cost for a similar-sized empty carrier to $464,400 from $391,700 under the non-roundtrip ballast tariff. The charge for a laden 174,000m³ carrier would increase to $534,900 from $476,760 — or to $481,410 from $421,800 if the same vessel were transiting empty. The 2023 tariff is also set to rise further under the proposed adjustment (see proposed new tariff table).  There is already a slim tariff-based incentive for charterers to use larger vessels to transport LNG via the canal. Under the current tariff, a 174,000m³ carrier — representative in size for most of the newer LNG ships — could face a charge for laden transit of around $2.74/m³, compared with $2.76/m³ for a 160,000m³ vessel, which would be closer to the global fleet average. Under the proposed adjustment, the larger laden tanker in 2023 would have a charge of $3.07/m³ while the smaller vessel would have a cost of $3.23/m³, widening this incentive to utilise vessels with larger capacities.  A public hearing on the proposal, as well as proposed adjustments affecting other shipping segments, will be held on 20 May, with the ACP also considering correspondence received by 17 May.

US rejects delay to gas gathering line safety rule,04 April 2022,By Chris Knight,"President Joe Biden's administration has denied an industry request to delay by 3-5 years what it says will be first-time, ""meaningful safety requirements"" for an estimated 90,000 miles (56,000km) of natural gas gathering lines. The longer that gathering lines are not subject to federal standards ""the greater the cumulative risk to public safety and the environment,"" the US Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) said in a 1 April letter denying the petition. The delay request was filed last year by trade groups the American Petroleum Institute and GPA Midstream. The safety standards remain set to take effect on 16 May, after which operators will have to begin reporting safety incidents along an estimated 400,000 miles of gas gathering lines. The operators of an estimated 90,000 miles of larger gathering lines have until 16 May 2023 to begin to comply with federal safety standards and submit annual reports. Gathering lines were historically small enough that PHMSA exempted many of them from oversight. But over the last 15 years, many lines have been built with similar designs and pressures to long-haul transmission pipelines, PHMSA says. The US Congress first told the agency to consider the rules in 2011, but the safety rule was not finalized until last November.  In the request for a delay, industry groups said PHMSA's 18-month compliance deadline for much of the rule was unnecessarily short and would pose high costs because of supply chain constraints. But PHMSA said industry has been aware of its plans for regulation for years. The agency also said the information now subject to annual reporting is the type of data that ""any responsible business"" would already have available, meaning reporting it will not be a hardship. PHMSA agreed to provide some clarifications in the rule. But it was unconvinced with industry arguments that compliance will cost operators $28bn over the next 15 years, or nearly 150 times higher than what the agency expected. PHMSA said the industry cost estimates were based on a ""severely flawed cost-benefit analysis.""","['<p class=""lead"">President Joe Biden\'s administration has denied an industry request to delay by 3-5 years what it says will be first-time, ""meaningful safety requirements"" for an estimated 90,000 miles (56,000km) of natural gas gathering lines.</p>', '<p>The longer that gathering lines are not subject to federal standards ""the greater the cumulative risk to public safety and the environment,"" the US Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) said in a 1 April letter denying the petition.

Brazil overrules 638MW of capacity auction,04 April 2022,By Rebecca Gompertz,"A Brazilian court has overruled the participation of six power plants in the counry's first capacity auction that took place in December. The six projects added up to 638MW in contracted capacity, with four of them being fuel oil-powered, while the other two were diesel-run. The plants had been allowed to participate in the tender via legal injunctions, despite a government-set cap fuel cost (CVU) of R600/MWh ($130/MWh). The excluded projects' CVUs range between R1,050.78/MWh-2,050.45/MWh. As the first capacity-only auction ever held in the country, the tender presented new rules with the cap CVU price, favoring natural gas and excluding more expensive fuel oil and diesel plants. It also determined an ""F factor"" — the minimum number of hours contracted plants would run and be paid for — of 120 hours/yr. That minimum is too low to make most natural gas plants competitive, but is not too low for fuel oil and diesel plants. These clashing determinations led fuel oil and diesel plants, unable to participate in the tender because of the cap price, to contest the decision in court. Brazil's highest state court accepted the argument at the time and allowed the plants to participate in the tender — with seven diesel and fuel oil plants winning the auction. But a later decision by the country's highest state court has overturned the initial decision. Market participants believed, at the time of the auction, that the tender would have to be at least partially redone during the first half of 2022 in case of an overruling such as this one.","['<p class=""lead"">A Brazilian court has overruled the participation of six power plants in the counry\'s first capacity auction that took place in December.</p>', ""<p>The six projects added up to 638MW in contracted capacity, with four of them being fuel oil-powered, while the other two were diesel-run.

Guyana to select acreage for new auctions: Correction,04 April 2022,By Canute James,"Guyana will select acreage to offer for new production sharing contracts later this year. Last month a government official told Argus the government would seek interest in the 11,200km² Takutu basin which lies 480km inland near the border with Brazil and the 26,800 km² ultradeep water Block C that is adjacent to the border with Suriname. But natural resources minister Vickram Bharrat later said a final decision has not been made as to which blocks will be offered in auction. Exploration and production contracts granted by Guyana so far have been on a non-competitive basis, with direct negotiations between the government and international oil companies. Guyana will change this system to the auctioning of blocks in the third quarter of this year, the government said. The natural resources ministry has not yet set a schedule for the auction of the blocks. All the South American country's oil has been produced from the ExxonMobil operated deepwater Stabroek block, but the country has ""substantial acreage onshore and offshore that remains untapped,"" the investment office said. The government will determine whether companies with existing contracts — such as ExxonMobil that operates a total of three deepwater blocks — should be excluded from the tenders, Guyana's vice president Bharrat Jagdeo said in November in announcing the change in awarding production contracts. ""We have to decide, however, whether we should do seismic surveys before auctioning as this would increase the value of the blocks, or just auction the blocks as they are,"" Jagdeo said. ""An alternative would be to vest all of these blocks into a national oil company."" ExxonMobil started production of 32.1°API Liza crude from the Stabroek block in December 2019. Its partners include US independent Hess and Chinese state-owned CNOOC unit Nexen.  Average output for this year is projected at 257,000 b/d, according to the government's budget plan. Three other Stabroek projects planned by ExxonMobil will raise output to over 800,000 b/d by 2026, the company has said.","['<p class=""lead"">Guyana will select acreage to offer for new production sharing contracts later this year.</p>', '<p>Last month a government official told <i>Argus </i>the government would seek interest in the 11,200km² Takutu basin which lies 480km inland near the border with Brazil and the 26,800 km² ultradeep water Block C that is adjacent to the border with Suriname.

Baltic alternative marine fuels project seek customers,05 April 2022,By Jonah Sweeney,"The Bornholm Bunker Hub is seeking partners and customers to further develop its green marine fuels project in the Baltic Sea. The project is a consortium including Bunker Holding Group, Danish renewables firm Orsted, marine fuel testing company Bureau Veritas, Finnish marine technology business Wartsila, and the port of Roenne, which launched a feasibility study last year into the financial viability of supplying sustainable marine fuels in the Baltic Sea from the island of Bornholm. It aims to supply green fuels such as methanol and ammonia to more than 60,000 ships that pass by the island every year, and wants to engage potential customers to identify expected demand.  Local production of power-to-x fuels, using 2GW of renewable power generated from the proposed Energy Island, which is scheduled to be established by 2030, would be an import element in making the site a competitive bunker hub.

Bitumen demand hit hard by Ukraine related price surge,05 April 2022,By Keyvan Hedvat ,"Bitumen consumption has been severely dented by the crude-led price spike in Mediterranean and European cargo and truck markets since the start of the Ukraine conflict. Evidence of a widespread sharp fall in demand has been most visible in north Africa and central Europe, while the start of the spring road construction season has been far slower across western Europe than is normal. Spanish fob cargo prices have jumped by nearly $250/t since mid-December, $100/t of that gain since the Ukraine conflict began on 24 February, reaching a $636/t peak on 11 March before edging back to $600/t now.  Egyptian state-owned EGPC has cancelled nearly 40,000t of cargo volumes it had awarded for April delivery into its Alexandria terminal, and postponed another. While the start-up of a new bitumen unit at one of EGPC's Suez refineries was a factor behind the move, Egypt's bitumen suppliers said there has been evidence of falling domestic demand and rising inventories n Egypt, while sharply rising prices will have added to issues in financing cargo deliveries.  In Algeria, which consumed around 750,000t of bitumen last year, March consumption estimates were at just 20,000t, a third of normal seasonal levels, with the current month of Ramadan likely to cause further slippage in construction activity and bitumen requirements across north Africa. Algerian constructors, like many others in the Mediterranean and parts of Europe, have slowed or delayed project work — many until May — in the hope that the Russia-Ukraine conflict will be resolved and prices fall, given numerous road tenders were awarded to them at values fixed at the time of the awards. That is very much the case in Romania, where there had been market expectations of an activity and demand surge this year from 650,000-700,000t in 2021. But the recent price surge has thrown construction firms' project spends off course as most Romanian road project tenders for current work were awarded at fixed values in 2019 and 2020. A spiralling government budget deficit worsened by the pandemic has also cut funding and caused major payment issues, with Bulgaria similarly affected. In those countries and across Europe, the spike in natural gas and diesel prices have driven up the cost of storing bitumen, which has to be heated to around 150°C, and of running mixed asphalt plants and construction machinery.  In numerous markets from Italy to Benelux, the new bitumen-consuming season has been slow to start, although Germany has been a notable exception of late, with many constructors biding their time before a belated project push. With Ukraine expected to remain out of the bitumen cargo market this year after importing at least 175,000t in 2021 into its Black Sea ports from the Mediterranean, this has contributed to keeping Mediterranean fob cargo values at discounts to fob Mediterranean high-sulphur fuel oil.  Rotterdam and non-Russian Baltic fob cargo values have strengthened considerably in recent weeks, caused mainly by supply-side tightness in northern Europe after the ATPC refinery in Antwerp ceased production, TotalEnergies' Donges refinery restart is awaited and Russian Baltic cargo exports — which totalled up to 400,000t last year — have come to a near halt since the Ukraine conflict began.  This has triggered a Mediterranean to north Europe arbitrage, even at high and rising bitumen tanker freight rates, providing modest supplier relief as they wait for the spot transatlantic arbitrage from Europe to the US to reopen after being unprofitable for several months.

Cliffs files for EAF air permit at Middletown,05 April 2022,By Rye Druzin,"Integrated steelmaker Cleveland-Cliffs has filed for an air permit related to a potential future electric arc furnace (EAF) at its Middletown, Ohio, integrated steel mill. The permit was filed for a parcel at the Middletown steelmaking site that appears to contain a handful of buildings. The Middletown blast furnace has a production capacity of 2.3mn short tons (st)/yr, according to data from the Association for Iron and Steel Technology.  The air permit listing cites ""proposed installation of an EAF melt shop and associated operations to produce steel slab."" The company has no plans to replace the Middletown blast furnace, which was relined a year ago and has at least 15 years of life left, Cliffs said in a statement. The blast furnace revamp was made to allow it to use more hot briquetted iron (HBI) in its melt operation, reducing its reliance on coking coal and lowering its carbon emissions. ""As far as permits, we at Cliffs always tend to plan ahead and keep options available for the future,"" the company said. ""We have done that several times in Minnesota. For example, not all permits are acted upon and certainly not all approved permits will result in [capital expenditure] deployment.

"EHB targets 28,000km of hydrogen pipelines by 2030",05 April 2022,By Killian Staines,"The European Hydrogen Backbone (EHB) initiative has stepped up its ambitions for a pan-European hydrogen pipeline network in response to EU proposals to boost green hydrogen production and imports. EHB, an industry association made up of gas transmission system operators (TSOs), now targets almost 28,000km of hydrogen pipelines by 2030, and 53,000km by 2040. Around 60pc of this would be repurposed existing natural gas pipelines, and 40pc would be new pipelines. This time last year the EHB proposed an 11,600km network by 2030, rising to 39,700km by 2040. The EHB has since grown to 31 TSOs from 28 countries, from 23 in 21. The EU's Repower EU strategy proposes 20.6mn t/yr of renewable hydrogen by 2030, including 10mn t/yr of imports, to replace around 25bn-50bn m³/yr of Russian gas. EHB proposes five supply and import corridors by 2030. One would connect supply from Tunisia and Algeria through Italy to central Europe, leveraging existing pipelines in Italy, Austria, Slovakia and Czech Republic. This could help decarbonise industry in southern Germany. A southwest corridor would transport green hydrogen produced in the Iberian peninsula through France into western Germany, and could eventually provide access to imports from Morocco. A corridor in the North Sea would build on Dutch plans for 2027, expanding this to a ring network connecting Rotterdam with the ports of Zeebrugge and Antwerp in Belgium, Wilhelmshaven and Brunsbuttel in Germany, and Le Havre in France, all of which are likely to play a role in importing hydrogen and its derivatives. A Nordic and Baltic corridor would tap offshore wind potential and could support hydrogen exports to central Europe, EHB said. But this would consist mostly of new pipelines, making it especially dependent on funding and a quick permitting and planning process, it said. A fifth corridor in eastern and southeast Europe could connect buyers in central Europe to regions with abundant renewable energy potential, such as Romania, Greece and Ukraine, through repurposed gas pipelines. But there is uncertainty around the evolution of future natural gas flows in this region, which affects development of this corridor, EHB said. Transport costs for hydrogen on onshore pipelines will be around €0.11-0.21/kg per 1,000km, compared with €0.17-0.32/kg for subsea pipelines, the EHB said.","['<p class=""lead"">The European Hydrogen Backbone (EHB) initiative has stepped up its ambitions for a pan-European hydrogen pipeline network in response to EU proposals to boost green hydrogen production and imports.</p>', '<p>EHB, an industry association made up of gas transmission system operators (TSOs), now targets almost 28,000km of hydrogen pipelines by 2030, and 53,000km by 2040.

Algerian crude exports flat in March,05 April 2022,By Elena Mataro,"Exports of Algeria's flagship Saharan Blend crude were broadly unchanged in March compared with the previous month, with rising European demand for the grade offset by a fall in cargoes bound for Asia-Pacific. Saharan Blend loadings were 389,000 last month, compared with 390,000 b/d in February, preliminary Argus tracking data show. Exports averaged 375,000 b/d in 2021.  Inclement weather conditions may have prompted delays in the March loading schedule. The ports of Arzew — where most Saharan Blend cargoes are loaded — and Bejaia closed for a few days last month because of bad weather. Exports to northwest Europe and the Mediterranean rose by nearly 5pc on the month to 304,000 b/d in March. The increase in European demand coincided with a shortage of competing light sweet grades. Most March-loading cargoes of Russian Siberian Light were cancelled or delayed, and Azeri Light cargoes loading from Supsa in the Black Sea in the second half of the month were cancelled because of security concerns related to the Ukraine conflict.  Appetite for Saharan Blend held steady despite Algeria's state-owned Sonatrach lifting its official March formula price by 35¢/bl to a $3.05/bl premium to the North Sea Dated benchmark, the widest premium in over 10 years.  The increase in shipments to northwest Europe and the Mediterranean was led by a 117pc jump in loadings to the UK to 105,000 b/d.

Corn: Argentina's corn ups on strong buying interest,05 April 2022,None,"Argentinian corn prices moved higher on Tuesday, supported by large purchases from South Korea, market participants said, with corn prices elsewhere also turning to gains after mostly moving down in the previous week.  Argentinian corn premiums were up slightly on Tuesday compared with Monday's close. Offers for Panamax-sized cargoes on an fob upriver basis heard in a range of ¢65-68/bu over the May Chicago Board of Trade futures contract, equalling to about $325-326/t amid rising CBOT futures at the time of writing. Prices for Argentina's corn were possibly boosted by an uptick in buying activity, with South Korea booking about five Panamax vessels of corn for shipment in May-June.  Meanwhile, Argentinian grain transporters plan to go on strike from midnight on 11 April because of high prices and low supply of fuel in the country. Should demonstrations last long enough to see port storage empty then it could begin to impact global buyers, with potential delays to corn shipments or cases of demurrage.  In the Black Sea region, Ukrainian corn prices were largely up, with offers for April-shipment contract heard in a range of $252-253/t dap Izov — $7-8/t above Monday's levels. In contrast, offers for May-shipment corn were heard at $255-256/t dap Izov, down by $1-2/t on the day, with bids unchanged at $250/t for shipment in May-June. But prices on a dap Chop basis were unchanged on Tuesday, with offers at $260/t and $265/t for shipment in the second half of April and May, respectively, and bids at $255/t for May shipment.  US corn prices also increased, with offers heard at ¢133/bu and ¢130/bu over the May CBOT contract for shipment in the second half of April and in the first half of May, respectively. Supply tightness on the global corn market continues to affect major importers' arrivals, with the EU-27's cumulative corn imports since July 2021 reaching a five-year low of 12.22mn t. But this was only marginally below the 12.30mn t imported over the same period of 2020-21, with the top five importers receiving more on the year.

How has the discussion about renewable LPG evolved over the past 12 months? The Climate Change Commission (CCC) recommended 12 months ago that New Zealand ends new gas connections to homes and businesses by 2025. We put a lot of effort into countering that advice, and it was successful. The new recommendation is that the government will consider ending new gas connections at a certain time, but there will be no immediate cut-off. Since then, we have made more progress, with the energy minister Megan Woods talking about renewable gases and not just hydrogen. What are the next steps in the transition to renewable alternatives? We expect the government to release its emissions reduction plan in May, so we will find out whether renewable gases have made their way back onto the agenda. We have a goal to have renewable LPG as a material part of the New Zealand energy mix by 2030. By 2025, we want to start introducing renewable blends with LPG. We need to further define the pathway of getting there. It is more than a goal. We are also working with the World LPG Association to decarbonise LPG. We are spending a lot of time looking at global research and access pathways. Are any regulatory changes required before renewable blends are sold? We have to get technical standards for renewable LPG that could be blended with fossil LPG for space heating, stoves, hot water systems and BBQ bottles. Renewable LPG is part of a wider fuel strategy by the New Zealand government. We plan to have a biofuel mandate next year, and New Zealand is looking at developing a sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) sector, and renewable LPG will be part of that. But we are not counting on it being an easy fix. What are the plans for renewable dimethyl ether (DME)? We are looking at renewable DME for LPG decarbonisation in New Zealand and it is not because longer term it is going to be better or worse than renewable LPG. But as we want to implement something quickly as the most technologically advanced alternative at the moment. For the areas we are looking at, it ticks a lot of boxes. What challenges does the industry face in its objective to decarbonise? Decarbonising LPG is really important for New Zealand. We only produce natural gas in one part of the country — Taranaki on the west coast of the North Island. We cannot transport that to any part of the South Island, nor every part of the North Island. You can drive for around an hour out of the capital Wellington and you will be in small towns where there is no natural gas pipeline, so people rely on LPG, and this is the case for large parts of the country. Is the Russia-Ukraine conflict affecting the New Zealand LPG sector? I think we are going to see a fast-tracking of the energy transition [as a result of the conflict in Ukraine] and the emergence of a more diverse energy system to help deal with these future energy shocks.","['<p class=""lead""><i>The New Zealand government\'s climate change advisory body in 2021 recommended that new natural gas and LPG connections be phased out from 2026 as part of plans to reach net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050.

Wheat: Prices turn to gains,05 April 2022,None,"Global wheat prices partially recouped losses from the start of the week, reflecting demand recovery in the past days and the sharp upward trend on the exchanges.  Russia's spot 12.5pc protein content wheat contract turned to gains, rising by $1.50/t on the day to $377.50/t — after falling by $10/t on Monday. Interest for Russian product remained low compared with other origins, with buyers avoiding submitting public bids for Russian product in view of heightened insurance risks for shipments from the origin.  Offers for Argentinian 11.5pc wheat on an fob upriver basis were also heard higher on Tuesday at $375/t for April shipment and $380/t for May shipment contracts, compared with $370/t for April on Monday.  Argentinian wheat prices — and other origins — could see support in the coming months from Argentinian grain workers' strike, scheduled to start next Monday, as reduced arrivals to ports could slow the country's busy line-up in the first half of April.  Meanwhile, some buying interest was heard for new-crop Argentinian 11.5pc wheat for December-January shipment on an fob upriver basis. And demand was also heard for Brazilian 12.5pc wheat for December shipment of a Panamax-sized vessel. On the European side, bids were heard for Romanian 11.5pc wheat at $390/t fob Constanta for shipment in the second half of April. Offers for Bulgarian 11.5pc wheat were heard lower on Tuesday at $400/t fob Constanta/Varna/Burgas (cvb), some $10-15/t below last Friday's levels.  Some trading interest was also heard for European new crop wheat for July-September shipment contracts. Bids were heard for Romanian 11.5pc wheat at a €3/t discount to the Euronext milling wheat September futures contract ($373/t) on an fob cvb basis for shipment in July. On the seller side, offers were heard for European 11.5pc wheat at €5/t over the Euronext September futures contract ($382/t) on an fob cvb basis for August-September shipment.  The cash and futures markets were not seen to take immediate direction from the EU Commission's expectations of record wheat exports from the bloc in 2022-23. The Commission pegged EU-27 exports at 40mn t for next season, up from 33mn t estimated for this year and nearly 3.5mn t above the previous record, reflecting stronger domestic supply and weaker consumption, paired with high international demand. Canadian Western Red Spring (CWRS) wheat prices made gains on Tuesday, following the sharp upward trend on the Minneapolis Grain Exchange (MGEX) and higher premiums.  The 13.5pc protein grade wheat prices moved up by $11.25/t to settle at $449.75/t fob Vancouver. The MGEX May contract was up by ¢19.2/bu on the day at the time of writing. Widening differentials further supported gains, with spot premiums to the MGEX May contract heard ¢7/bu higher at ¢120/bu. Canadian wheat exports in the last week were again low, reaching 171,300t and bringing total exports to 7.6mn t for the marketing year. This was 41pc behind year-ago levels.  But farmer sales were heard to pick up on Tuesday, as the MGEX May contract crossed the ¢1100/bu threshold. Farmer sales were focused on new-crop, limiting the upward trend at the near-end of the curve. Meanwhile, Japan returned to the market after a two-week break, issuing a wheat tender for shipment from 1-30 June from the US and Canada and 1-31 August from Australia. Some 59,000t was sought from Canada in the tender due to close on 7 April.

Brazil presents plan for hybrid power plants,05 April 2022,By Rebecca Gompertz,"Brazilian power clearing house CCEE has presented regulator Aneel with a document to be used in a report analyzing how to encourage greater use of hybrid power plants. The document should inform Aneel's pending report on hybrid power plants that will be the subject of public consultations later this year as the regulator develops rules for the emerging sector. Combining a diversity of power sources that can complement each at one plant is already a reality in Brazil, but on a small scale. Hybrid plants that produce power from a combination of sources, such as hydro and solar or thermal and wind, allow for more stable production, reduce exposure to fluctuations in spot power prices and optimize use of the electric grid. The public consultation will be a step toward regulating this new segment. Some arrangements can already be implemented immediately by CCEE without the need to change rules or procedures. The clearing house expects that new regulations will make all modes of hybrid power available by early next year.","['<p class=""lead"">Brazilian power clearing house CCEE has presented regulator Aneel with a document to be used in a report analyzing how to encourage greater use of hybrid power plants.</p>', ""<p>The document should inform Aneel's pending report on hybrid power plants that will be the subject of public consultations later this year as the regulator develops rules for the emerging sector.</p>"", '<p>Combining a diversity of power sources that can complement each at one plant is already a reality in Brazil, but on a small scale.

NY Harbor jet hits record highs amid shortage,05 April 2022,By Stephanie Crawford,"New York Harbor jet cash prices soared to consecutive daily record highs for the past two weeks as a lack of transatlantic and domestic imports perpetuated prompt regional shortages.  Since 24 March Buckeye and barge jet prices rose by $3.22/USG to close at $7.58/USG on 4 April as rising cash differentials outpaced declining futures. Jet differentials increased by $3.83/USG to May Nymex +$4.03/USG over the same period as bids struggled to find sellers in the spot market. The record rise in prompt cash values drove the forward curve into steep backwardation at $1.10/USG every five days from the prompt timeframe through late April.  The arbitrage from the US Gulf coast to New York Harbor was open on paper the past two weeks as a result of the strong gains in New York Harbor and relatively stable cash differentials in the Gulf coast. Regional spreads grew by $3.44/USG to a record high at $3.79/USG over the same time period. Despite the wide-open arbitrage, the Colonial pipeline distillates segment extending from Pasadena, Texas, to Greensboro, North Carolina, remained unallocated, while Colonial line space value was negative at -0.65¢/USG through yesterday.  Global transatlantic cargo shipments heading to New York Harbor rose from zero in February to 123,600 tons in March, but those imports are not scheduled to arrive until mid to late April and early May, according to Vortexa. Regional jet stocks fell to a ten-week low during the last week of March at 7.6mn bl and were 20pc below the five-year average, according to data from the Energy Information Administration.","['<p class=""lead"">New York Harbor jet cash prices soared to consecutive daily record highs for the past two weeks as a lack of transatlantic and domestic imports perpetuated prompt regional shortages. </p>', '<p>Since 24 March Buckeye and barge jet prices rose by $3.22/USG to close at $7.58/USG on 4 April as rising cash differentials outpaced declining futures.

US HRC: Mills push prices gradually up,05 April 2022,None,"US hot-rolled coil (HRC) prices continued to increase at slower rates, as the market awaited the ferrous scrap trade and some mills continued to hold off opening up their May books. The Argus weekly domestic US HRC Midwest and southern assessments rose by $48/short ton (st) and $60/st, respectively, to $1,500/st.  Both prices are up by 47pc since hitting a low around $1,022/st on 1 March. HRC lead times in the Midwest were flat at 5-6 weeks, as some mills started to transact for May and other continued to wait to offer up May tons. Most HRC offers were at $1,500/st, with some heard above that level. The expectation for the April US ferrous scrap trade have been tempered, down from expectations of upwards of $200/gross ton (gt) down to the low $100/gt range. The spread between #1 busheling delivered US Midwest consumer and pig iron cfr New Orleans is $344/gt, with pig iron at $1,026/gt. HRC import prices into Houston made their largest jump in Argus' 3.5 year history, skyrocketing by $293/st to $1,543/st ddp as limited import offers started to flow back in to the US. Much of the pipeline had been cut off for months as US prices fell and global prices remained elevated. The spread between #1 busheling scrap delivered US Midwest mills and HRC selling prices rose by 5.7pc to $891/st. A year ago the spread was $812/st. The spread between pig iron cfr New Orleans and Midwest and southern HRC prices rose by 9pc compared to the prior week to $584/st. The Argus weekly domestic US cold-rolled coil (CRC) assessment rose by $50/st to $1,900/st, while the hot-dipped galvanized (HDG) assessment increased by $52/st to $1,900/st. Lead times for CRC rose to 7-9 weeks from 6-8 weeks while HDG lead times rose to 7-9 weeks from 7-8 weeks. The CME HRC Midwest futures market largely fell in the last week after multiple weeks of increases. May futures pricing rose by $25/st to $1,595/st compared to the last week, while June pricing was down by $15/st to $1,546/st. July future pricing declined by $25/st to $1,510/st, while August futures slipped by $5/st to $1,490/st.

Galp to supply gas for Brazil's Gasmig,05 April 2022,By Flávia Pierry,"Brazilian local gas distributor Gasmig, located at Minas Gerais state, signed a natural gas supply agreement with oil and gas producer Galp.  The 260,000m³/d gas supply agreement started on 1 April and runs through 31 December 2023. Pricing conditions were not disclosed.  Gasmig president Pedro Magalhães said the company is still searching for other gas suppliers, which may lead to smaller final tariffs for consumers. Gasmig has two other gas supply agreements with state-run producer Petrobras, for 1,750mn m³/d (valid until 2023); and for 480,000m³/d in 2022, 422,000m³/d in 2023, 374,000m³/d in 2024 and 312,000m³/d in 2025.

Lower emissions require more metals investment: BHP,06 April 2022,By Kevin Morrison,"Limiting global warming in line with the 2015 Paris climate agreement will require a significant lift in investments in new metals production capacity, although minerals mining can be emissions intensive, according to Australian resources firm BHP. The 2015 Paris climate agreement aims to limit the rise in global average temperatures to below 2°C, and preferably to 1.5°C. Action to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions must be taken as soon as possible, as delayed action will be significantly more costly in monetary and socio-environmental terms, BHP vice-president for market analysis and economics Huw McKay said.  Policies on emissions reduction must address all fundamental elements of the energy transition to allow the demand and supply sides of the system to adjust as required, he added. Carbon pricing is a core ingredient of any effective policy framework to reduce emissions, McKay said. ""None of the [actions required] will be feasible if the supply of metals does not keep pace with the spectacular demands expected to be created by the needs of the energy transition,"" said McKay. The dilemma for investors is that metals are essential inputs for the hardware of decarbonisation, and there will be no energy transition without a significant increase in the production of critical minerals, but the production of minerals can itself be a GHG emission-intensive process, according to McKay.  The energy transition will require a vast capital reallocation and will generate material risks and opportunities, placing investors and global capital markets at the very centre of the challenge, he added. Under the International Energy Agency's (IEA) net zero 2050 scenario, annual average energy capital investments would rise from around $2 trillion at present, or 2.5pc of gross domestic product (GDP), to around $5 trillion for the period from 2021-50, or 4.5pc of GDP in 2030 and falling to 2.5pc of GDP by 2050, McKay said. All low emissions energy technologies require metals, from the nickel used in electric batteries, steel used in wind turbines, silver and silicon used in solar panels, to the copper that will enable further electrification, he added. Challenges also remain for the development of many metal deposits. The discovery, appraisal and development of new metal deposits is a time and capital-intensive process, where a decade from start to first production would be regarded as ""incredibly swift"", according to McKay.  ""Exploration success has been only modest over the last decade, and in the case of copper, the bellwether for both the base metal complex and the electrification mega-trend, grade decline is expected to become a material headwind for primary supply over the course of this decade,"" said McKay. The industry does not currently have an abundance of high-quality development opportunities ready to go, and scrap supply is insufficient to fill the gap, according to BHP.","['<p class=""lead"">Limiting global warming in line with the 2015 Paris climate agreement will require a significant lift in investments in new metals production capacity, although minerals mining can be emissions intensive, according to Australian resources firm BHP.</p>', '<p>The 2015 Paris climate agreement aims to limit the rise in global average temperatures to below 2°C, and preferably to 1.5°C.

India extends foreign PE compliance deadline to October,06 April 2022,By Matthew Rajendra,"The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) has again extended its quality control deadline for all foreign polyethylene (PE) producers to 3 October this year.  The BIS first announced the implementation of quality control standards on low-density polyethylene (LDPE), linear low-density polyethylene and high-density polyethylene in April last year. Foreign producers were originally given until October 2021 to obtain their BIS certifications. The BIS announced another extension in October to 6 April 2022. Market participants cited travel restrictions arising from the Covid-19 pandemic as the main obstacle in securing BIS certifications. Plant inspections by Indian officials are a crucial part of the approval process. Quarantine restrictions have made it difficult for Indian officials to travel and inspect foreign PE plants.  Middle East producers said plant inspections have yet to be done, with no officials assigned to carry out these inspections at their PE plants. Some producers have requested Indian officials to conduct inspections after the Islamic fasting month of Ramadan occurring this month as plant operations have been reduced.  The easing of Covid-19 restrictions worldwide is expected to make plant inspections easier in the coming months. Some participants have welcomed the implementation of these standards. Indian converters have reported receiving off-grade PE cargoes, resulting in problems during the manufacturing process and manufactured goods of inferior quality. But other participants have pushed back on the standards because of expectations of tightened availability to the Indian market, especially for specialty PE grades.  Repeated extensions on compliance deadlines have been an issue for market participants. Uncertainty increased last September, prompting key Middle East producers to raise offer prices and delay shipments until an official announcement from the BIS.  The announcement of another BIS extension comes days after India's commerce ministry recommended anti-dumping duties on LDPE imports.

UK has ‘very little sunflower oil left’: NEODA,06 April 2022,By Matt Bowen,"The UK has ""very little stocks"" of sunflower oil (SFO) left and will see ""supply dwindling"" in the coming weeks as a result of a severe supply shortage caused by the conflict in Ukraine, the President of the National Edible Oil Distributors' Association (NEODA) said. ""There is very little [sunflower] oil left in the UK,"" Gary Lewis, the president of NEODA, told Argus. ""We are reliant on constant supplies, but they have been sharply reduced since the attacks on Ukraine… supplies are dwindling."" When asked about supply issues going forward, Lewis said that the UK is seeing ""no further supplies coming in at this time"" but added that NEODA was monitoring the situation ""on a monthly basis"".  According to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), the UK is expected to consume 340,000t of SFO domestically in the 2021-22 marketing year, with the product a vital ingredient in foods such as crisps and chips. But the nation has a very limited production capacity of just 11,000 t/yr.  As a result, the UK relies heavily on imports, with the USDA projecting 340,000t to be purchased in 2021-22, the majority of which would normally come from Ukraine and Russia.  Ukraine is the world's largest producer of SFO, followed by Russia, with the two nations exporting 77pc of the world's SFO between them.  But the USDA estimates that just 2.94mn t of SFO was exported by Ukraine between September 2021-February 2022, out of the 5.75mn t projected for exports in the whole marketing year. And with exports from Ukraine's Black and Azov Seas blocked since the beginning of the conflict on 24 February, the world may be unable to replace the 2.81mn t drop in supply. ""The EU and Argentina are also producers, but they cannot offset the losses from Ukraine,"" Lewis said.  With the UK's stocks of SFO plummeting and the conflict in Ukraine looking set to continue, importers and consumers will need to turn their attention to alternative products. ""Customers will have to be more open minded in terms of oil supply and need to explore other oils, including soybean oil,"" Lewis said.  Rapeseed oil is another substitute that has been touted as a potential alternative to SFO. But while Lewis said that the NEODA has ""seen a number of customers move to rapeseed oil"", he also indicated that supplies of this product were now also running low because of the increased demand. ""We are now in a situation where we can't offer any additional rapeseed until August,"" he said.  And the longer the conflict in Ukraine continues, the worse the edible oil supply crunch will get. Despite efforts to export grains and oils by rail, Ukraine was only able to deliver 9,000t of the product to the EU 27 in the week to 27 March. Prior to the conflict, the nation averaged exports of 122,500 t/week to the bloc.

Brazil revises 2022 power demand growth lower,06 April 2022,By Rebecca Gompertz,"Brazil's power demand growth in 2022 is expected to be 1 percentage point lower than previously expected, partly reflecting slower economic growth, according to the latest government projections. The new numbers are part of the first four-month revision of the data for the country's yearly energy plan and point to average demand of 70,739MW for the year, from a previous prediction of 71,373MW, according to projections by grid operator ONS, power clearing house CCEE and government energy research agency Epe. Previous estimates had the country's power demand showing growth of 2.7pc for 2022 and have now been readjusted to 1.7pc growth for this year over 2021.

Self-generators dispute cost allocation in bill,06 April 2022,By Rebecca Gompertz,"A Brazilian bill aimed at modernizing the power sector, known as PL 414, also attempts to limit who gets the benefits of industrial self-generation, without hindering  expansion of investments. Industrial self-generators are large energy consumers who seek to build power plants to totally or partially meet their own demand, with or without the participation of other investors.  Some lawmakers and business groups say a number of investors in industrial self-generation are unfairly reaping the benefits of the projects without being exposed to the associated risks of the power market, and take advantage of loopholes to get power surcharge discounts. PL 414 proposes limitations for self-generators with demand under 30MW, such as the payment of surcharges that were not previously collected from self-generators, as a way to incentivize capacity expansion.  Industrial self-generation proponents claim the bill will just hinder investments and expansion of national generation capacity. Brazilian self-generation investors' association Abiape's president Mario Menel wants a change to the language of the bill that would establish a 30pc threshold of capital stock in a power plant for a group to be considered a self-generator and reap the benefits that that brings. The association also wants the bill text to make it easier for groups who generate energy at a different location from where it will be consumed to be classified as self-generators, and wants to preserve benefits for projects already granted self-generator status if they are built within five years after the bill becomes law. Abiape further proposes an increase in minimum demand for self-generators, from 3MW to 5MW, to differentiate self-generation from distributed generation once the Brazilian electricity market opens.  Currently, self-generation operates only via bilateral contracts, while distributed generation remains in the regulated market. Once the free market becomes accessible to all consumers, the power industryconsiders it important to have a clear differentiation between the two. Some market participants fear the bill will scare investors away by making smaller projects less attractive. Fernando Elias, regulation and trading director at renewable energy supplier Casa dos Ventos, worries that the bill's text will compromise the expansion of renewable energy as companies, in addition to providing capital to expand the matrix, enter long-term contracts to make the new plants viable.","['<p class=""lead"">A Brazilian bill aimed at modernizing the power sector, known as PL 414, also attempts to limit who gets the benefits of industrial self-generation, without hindering </p>', '<p class=""lead"">expansion of investments.</p>', '<p>Industrial self-generators are large energy consumers who seek to build power plants to totally or partially meet their own demand, with or without the participation of other investors. </p>', '<p>Some lawmakers and business groups say a number of investors in industrial self-generation are unfairly reaping the benefits of the projects without being exposed to the associated risks of the power market, and take advantage of loopholes to get power surcharge discounts. <a href=""https://direct.argusmedia.com/newsandanalysis/article/2313969"">PL 414</a> proposes limitations for self-generators with demand under 30MW, such as the payment of surcharges that were not previously collected from self-generators, as a way to incentivize capacity expansion. </p>', ""<p>Industrial self-generation proponents claim the bill will just hinder investments and expansion of national generation capacity.

US court faults Signal Peak coal mine expansion review,06 April 2022,By Elena Vasilyeva,"The US Interior Department's Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE) fell short in its environmental review of a plan to expand Signal Peak's Bull Mountains underground coal mine in Montana, the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals said. In a 2-1 decision on 4 April, the court ruled that OSMRE did not provide any ""convincing rationale"" for determining that expanding the mine would have no significant impact on greenhouse gas emissions. It determined that the agency violated the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), partially upheld a 2020 ruling from the US District Court for the District of Montana and remanded the case back to the lower court. But the appeals court kept OSMRE's approval of the expansion in place and left it up to the lower court to determine whether the agency needs to perform a more comprehensive environmental impact statement. ""Additional factfinding is necessary,"" to decide whether OSMRE needs to conduct an environmental impact statement, the majority opinion said. While OSMRE ""did not account for the emissions generated by coal combustion, obscuring and grossly understating the magnitude of the mine expansion's emissions relative to other domestic sources of GHGs,"" the judges in the majority were ""not persuaded"" that the agency needed to use the so-called social cost of carbon metric — which was espoused by environmental groups in the lawsuit — to quantify the costs of GHG emissions. They also said it was not clear that OSMRE had any other measure available to examine the environmental affect of the project. The ruling is a partial victory for environmental groups including the Sierra Club, Montana Environmental Information Center, WildEarth Guardians and Western Environmental Law Center. The groups initially sued OSMRE in 2015 claiming the agency violated NEPA when it published a finding of no significant impact that allowed Signal Peak to access an additional 2,540 acres of federal land. Signal Peak also has state regulatory approval to access additional state and private property that brings the total expansion area to 7,161 acres with 176mn short tons (160mn metric tonnes) of coal reserves. The US District Court for the District of Montana agreed with the environmental groups in 2017, and halted operations on the mine expansion while OSMRE performed another review. The court later mostly upheld the revised environmental assessments OSMRE published in 2018 and in 2020. Allowing Signal Peak to mine from the expansion area would produce about 240mn tons of greenhouse gas pollution according to Sierra Club staff attorney Nathaniel Shoaff.  ""The most important thing is that now it is absolutely the clear that the ultimate decider here is going to be the administration of President Joe Biden,"" he said. The administration will have to ""take a new look at the climate impacts of this mine, and then decide whether it allow this expansion to go forward or not.""  Signal Peak and OSMRE declined to comment. The Bull Mountains mine produced 7.25mn st of coal last year, which was up from 2020 and 2019 but down from 7.57mn st in 2018, according to US Mine Safety and Health Administration data. The Montana mine produces a higher-heat 10,300 Btu/lb coal.

US Supreme Court reinstates Trump permitting rule,06 April 2022,By Chris Knight,"The US Supreme Court today revived a rule issued under former president Donald Trump that curtailed the ability of states to use water permits to block the construction of natural gas pipelines, coal export terminals and other facilities. The Supreme Court, in a 5-4 unsigned order, reinstated a 2020 permitting rule that imposed new restrictions on when a state could deny ""section 401"" water quality permits that are typically required for pipelines and other major projects. The Trump administration issued the rule in response to concerns that states were using those permits as a backdoor veto against new fossil fuel infrastructure. A federal district court last year threw out the Trump-era rule, reverting the US back to water permitting rules that had previously been in effect since 1971. But the Supreme Court's order today sided with Louisiana and other states that pushed to suspend that ruling based on concerns that other states would ""return to their abusive practices"" by blocking projects.  The order marks another instance of the Supreme Court's using its so-called ""shadow docket"" to weigh in on cases without a written opinion or oral arguments. The Supreme Court used similar emergency procedures to block Covid-19 vaccine mandates and in 2020 to reinstate separate streamlined water permits used by pipelines for small stream crossings.  Supreme Court justice Elena Kagan, writing the dissent today, said Louisiana and other states failed to show they would face ""irreparable harm"" from the 1971-era permitting regulations going back into force.

North Sea-focused Ithaca buys Cambo field operator,08 April 2022,By Jon Mainwaring,"Ithaca Energy has agreed to buy fellow North Sea-focused independent Siccar Point Energy for up to $1.46bn. The move will see Israeli-owned Ithaca acquire a majority stake in the controversial Cambo oil field, located west of Shetland, along with a package of other UK offshore assets. Ithaca, a subsidiary of Tel Aviv-listed Delek, said the takeover of Siccar Point reinforces its position as a leading operator in the UK's upstream oil and gas sector. The company, an active UK offshore producer since 2008, already established itself as the second-largest independent operator in the UK North Sea on acquiring a bundle of Chevron assets for $2bn in November 2019.  The Siccar deal will give Ithaca a 70pc stake in the undeveloped Cambo field, which was recently granted a two-year extension to the terms of its licences by the North Sea Transition Authority. Cambo became the focal point of environmental protests against new UK offshore oil and gas field developments in the run-up to last year's Cop 26 climate talks in Glasgow. After much criticism over its involvement in the field, Shell, which still owns a 30pc stake, said last December that it no longer sees a strong enough economic case for investing in the project. But last week it said that the licence extension ""will allow time to evaluate all potential future options"". Ithaca expects to take a final investment decision (FID) on Cambo — estimated to contain 170mn bl of recoverable oil — next year. It also expects an FID in 2023 on the nearby Equinor-operated Rosebank field, in which it has acquired a 20pc interest and which is estimated to hold as much as 300mn bl of recoverable oil. Along with the Cambo and Rosebank stakes, Ithaca will acquire stakes in the producing Schiehallion, Mariner and Jade fields. It is also picking up operated and non-operated interests in a number of exploration-stage licences. The company noted that not only will it see an immediate boost to its oil and gas production, but the acquired assets also offer ""significant room for growth through future drilling"". The overall impact of the acquisition is expected to double Ithaca's recoverable reserves and support production of 80,000-90,000 b/d of oil equivalent (boe/d) over the next decade, the company said, up from 56,500 boe/d last year. ""This is a transformational deal for the company which cements Ithaca's position as a leading independent E&amp;P operator in the North Sea,"" Ithaca chief executive Alan Bruce said. ""The development of the Cambo and Rosebank fields is a huge opportunity to not only help secure the UK's energy future for at least another quarter of a century, but also to create thousands of direct and indirect jobs in the process.""

Japan's ONE conducts successful trial of marine biofuel,08 April 2022,By Jonah Sweeney,"Japanese container shipping company Ocean Network Express (ONE) said it has successfuly trialed a marine biofuel supplied by BP. ONE, which is jointly owned by Japanese firms NYK, Mol and K-Line, bunkered the M/V NYK Fujiin Singapore with 1,300t of a marine biofuel blend. It then deployed on ONE's route to South Africa and began trialling the fuel after passing through the strait of Malacca, continuing on to Durban and Cape Town before returning to southeast Asia. The 1,300t of fuel were used in 45 days. The product consisted of brown grease methyl ester (BGME) a type of fatty acid methyl ester (Fame) derived from 100pc waste or residue feedstocks, blended with conventional very low sulphur fuel oil (VLSFO).

Opec+ March output sees first fall in 13 months,08 April 2022,None,"Production from Opec+ deal participants fell in March for the first time in 13 months, with international sanctions and buyers' reluctance to take crude from Russia beginning to bite into output from the non-Opec leader. Deal participants' production fell by 190,000 b/d to 38.06mn b/d in March, 1.48mn b/d below the month's target according to Argus' survey. This is the first production retreat since February 2021, when output receded by 770,000 b/d because of an additional 1mn b/d cut implemented by Saudi Arabia.  Most of the March drop was concentrated in Nigeria, Kazakhstan and Russia, although 15 of the 19 Opec+ participants produced below their targets. UAE energy minister Suhail al-Mazrouei in late March called for higher oil and gas investment to counter uncertainty over future supply. ""Every country is facing a reduction [in capacity]… natural decline, and we have seen it,"" he said. ""In the Opec+ group alone, we lost 1mn b/d over the year. And God knows this year how many more barrels we will lose."" Russian output declined for the first month in more than a year, signalling international isolation is taking a toll. Its output dropped by 50,000 b/d in the first full month of its war with Ukraine, leaving it 330,000 b/d under its 10.33mn b/d target — a quota that exceeds Russia's 10.3mn b/d capacity, as assessed by Argus. Production this month could fall by 4-5pc from March, deputy prime minister Alexander Novak said yesterday. Formal and informal sanctions are yet to depress Russian crude exports, although US restrictions have removed a major outlet for the country's upgradeable residues, pushing domestic runs down by 500,000 b/d and freeing 120,000 b/d of additional crude for export last month. The medium sour Urals grade accounted for most increases, as term buyers honoured pre-agreed contracts, and Indian refiners stepped in to procure heavily discounted spot supply. ""If there [is] fuel available and available at a discount, why shouldn't I buy it? I need it for my people,"" Indian finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said last week, signalling India could buy more Russian crude. Chinese refiners appear to be buying ESPO Blend and could continue to do so, even though demand has been choked by measures to tackle resurging Covid-19 infections. Output fell from the non-Opec group's second largest producer, Kazakhstan, because storm damage to two of three single point mooring (SPM) buoys at the CPC export terminal forced a late-March shutdown at the Tengiz field. The CPC consortium forecasts the terminal could fully resume loadings within three-to-four weeks of the SPM incident. Opec heavyweight Saudi Arabia's production was flat in March, when Yemen's Houthi rebels launched missile attacks at facilities operated by state-controlled Aramco causing a drop in throughput at the 400,000 b/d Yasref refinery. Riyadh said it will not incur any consequent ""responsibility for any shortage in oil supplies to global markets"" arising from the attacks. Some analysts flagged sharp Saudi export declines, which top 400,000 b/d according to preliminary Argus tracking. Nigerian production fell the most among Opec producers, dropping by 100,000 b/d to put it 310,000 b/d under its quota. Italian integrated Eni declared and lifted force majeure on Brass River crude because of a pipeline explosion, and Shell put similar restrictions on the Bonny Light terminal that it has yet to lift. Pipeline vandalism and sabotage have stymied Nigerian output since the second half of last year, with Abuja's compliance averaging 227pc since July. Production trends diverged among the deal-exempt members. Libyan output fell by 70,000 b/d after a valve closure drove an early-March shutdown at the 300,000 b/d El Sharara and 90,000 b/d El Feel fields. Iranian production rose by 30,000 b/d, with domestic consumption increasing ahead of the Nowruz holiday period. Exports picked up to 930,000–1mn b/d, according to analysts and tracking.

USDA corta estimativa da soja; milho sobe,08 April 2022,Por Nathalia Giannetti,"O Departamento de Agricultura dos Estados Unidos (USDA, na sigla em inglês) reduziu pelo quarto mês consecutivo a estimativa para a produção da soja 2021-22 do Brasil, mas aumentou a projeção da atual safra de milho.  A previsão é que a safra de soja brasileira atinja 125 milhões de t, queda de 2 milhões de t em relação ao relatório anterior publicado em março. Abril é o quarto mês consecutivo com cortes nas estimativas de produção do USDA. O relatório de janeiro foi o primeiro a conter mudanças desde maio de 2021, quando a projeção para a safra da oleaginosa de 2021-22 estava em 144 milhões de t. As estimativas de exportação também caíram este mês, de 85,5 milhões de t para 82,75 milhões de t, enquanto as previsões para estoques iniciais e finais subiram. O volume esperado para os estoques iniciais da soja 2021-22 cresceu 1,45 milhão de t, alcançando 29,4 milhões de t. Os estoques finais agora estão estimados em 21,6 milhões de t, ante 21 milhões de t no mês passado. Já as projeções para consumo doméstico aumentaram de 48,9 milhões de t para 50,5 milhões de t.  A redução nas estimativas da soja é uma consequência direta do tempo seco que reduziu a produtividade das lavouras nos estados da região Sul durante os meses de dezembro e janeiro.  A produção estimada da safra de milho de 2021-22 subiu para 116 milhões de t, alta de 2 milhões de t no mês. O volume esperado para exportações subiu 1,5 milhão de t e alcançou 44,5 milhões de t.

N American wood pellet exports hit 10-year Feb high,08 April 2022,By John Cooper ,"North American wood pellet exports reached fresh highs in February, mostly on higher US shipments to Japan, the UK and Denmark.  Combined US and Canadian exports were at their highest for February in at least 10 years — at 833,000t, up from 790,000t a year earlier.  US exports rose to 629,000t from 557,000t, with higher deliveries to the UK, Denmark and Japan more than offsetting lower shipments to Belgium and the Netherlands. Exports to the latter fell to 49,000t from 123,000t.  Increased heating demand in the UK and Denmark drove US exports. Deliveries to the UK grew by 76,000t to 437,000t, with deliveries to Denmark rising 26,000t from close to zero. And the US exported 30,000t to Japan in February, the highest monthly amount for at least 10 years. Canadian exports fell to 204,000t in February from 233,000 a year earlier. A significant drop in shipments to the UK, which more than halved on the year to 60,000t, was partly offset by a rise in exports to Asia. Japanese receipts rose to 87,000t from 80,000t as long-term contracts kicked in, with exports to South Korea reaching 30,000t in February, up from zero a year earlier.  Wood pellet exports increased at five of the US' nine major ports in February. Savannah exported 105,000t, up from 64,000t a year earlier, while Baton Rouge loadings rose by 5,000t to 104,000t. Exports from Wilmington, Delaware, hit 67,000t, after falling to almost zero a year earlier. The Virginian port of Norfolk remained the largest exporter of wood pellets in the US, despite loadings falling to 143,000t from 155,000t.  Combined exports at Canada's two major ports in British Columbia increased to 178,000t from 172,000t. Prince Rupert loaded 92,000t, while the Port of Vancouver loaded 86,000t, down from 103,000t.","['<p class=""lead"">North American wood pellet exports reached fresh highs in February, mostly on higher US shipments to Japan, the UK and Denmark. </p>', '<p>Combined US and Canadian exports were at their highest for February in at least 10 years — at 833,000t, up from 790,000t a year earlier. </p>', '<p>US exports rose to 629,000t from 557,000t, with higher deliveries to the UK, Denmark and Japan more than offsetting lower shipments to Belgium and the Netherlands.

US rebar: Prices rise on steady demand,08 April 2022,None,"US domestic rebar prices were assessed higher this week, continuing an upward trend caused by inflationary sentiment and difficulty sourcing raw materials. The Argus rebar ex-works Midwest price was assessed at $1,110-1,300/short ton, reflecting stronger demand than this time last year, despite record-high prices. Imported rebar ddp Houston was assessed at $1,340-1,350/st as overseas production continued to be hampered by supply chain disruptions in Europe. Formal price increases expected by market participants failed to materialize this week as the scrap trade settled flat-to-down in April for obsolete grades. A market participant posited the possibility of a lower price increase than previously expected. West coast rebar fabricator Pacific Steel announced the construction of a new 380,000st/yr hybrid micro mill in southern California expected to come on line by early 2025. The announcement comes as Pacific is embroiled in a legal dispute with long steelmaker Commercial Metals (CMC) over a non-compete agreement CMC allegedly made with Italian micro mill producer Danieli.

Lake negotiates with Ford on Argentina's Kachi lithium,11 April 2022,By Angus Macmillan,"Australian lithium developer Lake Resources has entered into a non-binding initial agreement to negotiate with US auto producer Ford for the supply of approximately 25,000 t/yr of lithium from its Kachi project in Argentina. Lake and Ford will also consider a strategic collaboration arrangement to fully develop a clean lithium supply chain to meet global environmental demand for electric vehicles (EVs), Lake said. Lake last month agreed a similar initial deal with Japanese commodities firm Hanwa for up to 25,000 t/yr of lithium carbonate from Kachi over 10 years.  The agreement with Lake is one of several Ford is exploring to secure raw materials to support its aggressive EV acceleration, adding that Ford is ""sourcing deeper into the battery supply chain"", said its vice-president for EV industrialisation Lisa Drake.

Trucks to coexist with pipes in Brazil’s gas market,11 April 2022,By Flávia Pierry,"Brazil's natural gas industry is looking toward trucks to avert pipeline bottlenecks, expand consumption regionally and partially replace household LPG use as LNG freight is less than $1/mmBtu above LPG freight. LPG logistics specialist firm Contatto estimates it costs $1.079/mmBtu to truck LPG 600km, while the same amount of LNG would cost $1.99/mmBtu to truck, with both rates excluding taxes and tolls. ""The cost difference for a maximum 600km route freight is not substantial to determine the fuel,"" Contatto executive director Walter Vighy said. ""The terms of the supply agreement are decisive in the fuel option, whether on-the-spot or long-term, and the place of delivery. For longer distance routes, above 2,000km, the freight difference from LPG to LNG can reach $3-4/mmBtu. Even so, for the current [gas and LPG price] levels, these values have a low impact on the decision."" The lack of transportation pipeline capacity in Brazil is among the hindrances to expanding natural gas consumption. Compressed natural gas carried in trucks is perceived as a threat to LPG for large consumers, but not yet for medium and small volumes, a market source said. Gas transportation pipelines in Brazil total 9,400km, less than 1pc the length of the US grid. Even in regions served by the pipelines, there are capacity limitations to meet transportation demand. The TBG pipeline in the southern region, bringing gas from Bolivia, has no spare capacity for new gas carriers unless state-run Petrobras relinquishes its own. The NTS pipeline in the southeastern region has not yet launched an open season to allow gas carriers to acquire firm transportation capacity for 2022, four months after the start of the new gas market. These limitations are causing some natural gas market participants to opt for compressed or liquefied deliveries by truck. Pernambuco and Santa Catarina states' local distributors Copergás and SCGás have signed supply agreements to bring LNG from ports by truck directly to distribution grids. The creation of regional distribution grids away from the transportation network is being studied by local distribution companies as a way to reach new clients and expand markets. Alagoas state's proposed gas law, which is being discussed and will be submitted to the state chamber, will allow gas distribution company Algas to build regional grids. Trucked gas deliveries directly to distribution grids can be a way to gradually build demand, which is needed to justify pipelines. This can make more sense in Brazil, where financial conditions for long-term investments are not as attractive as in more developed countries.  Trucks can be complementary to pipelines or for off-grid gas production such as biomethane, but must not be considered a long-term solution as its higher costs are shared among all consumers using the same grid, said Adrianno Lorenzon, natural gas director at the large energy consumers association Abrace. ""Trucked gas deliveries to distribution grids should not be maintained ad aeternum, or it is a crossed subsidy, when some customers are paying for others,"" said Lorenzon.  For large gas consumers seeking bilateral supply agreements away from local distribution, the trucked option is not yet a trend but it started happening with some small-scale LNG. Edmar Almeida, professor of energy economics at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, considers truck transportation a permanent option that will coexist with pipelines in areas where pipe construction is not feasible. ""We see this part of the gas market focusing on CNG. I believe that LNG and biomethane transportation will expand,"" Almeida said.","['<p class=""lead"">Brazil\'s natural gas industry is looking toward trucks to avert pipeline bottlenecks, expand consumption regionally and partially replace household LPG use as LNG freight is less than $1/mmBtu above LPG freight.</p>', '<p>LPG logistics specialist firm Contatto estimates it costs $1.079/mmBtu to truck LPG 600km, while the same amount of LNG would cost $1.99/mmBtu to truck, with both rates excluding taxes and tolls.</p>', '<p>""The cost difference for a maximum 600km route freight is not substantial to determine the fuel,"" Contatto executive director Walter Vighy said.

Hydropower revision necessary but still not ideal,11 April 2022,By Rebecca Gompertz,"Brazil's proposal to revise hydroelectric power plant nameplate generation capacity is necessary to gaining a more realistic view of the grid matrix, but more changes may be needed. Hydroelectric plants' nameplate generation is defined by the mines and energy ministry when first granting their concessions. Later reviews cannot decrease the capacity number by more than 5pc at a time, and only by 10pc total, as established by law to assure entrepreneurs certain revenue expectations will be met when acquiring the concessions. There is concern among power market participants in Brazil that real capacity might be running below the nameplate numbers set in contracts, as rivers and other water flows change with time and human activity. The mines and energy ministry opened a public consultation over the proposed capacity revision that is expected to happen before the end of the year, with an action plan for the next year. The initiative is a priority for the sector, according to large energy consumer association Abrace's electricity director, Victor Iocca. Abrace's contributions to the proposed revision suggest a 5pc limit to the increase in plants' nameplate generation capacity, to provide some balance to the system for the plants that should have their numbers decreased but cannot because of the 5pc decrease cap.  The association also asks that state-run Eletrobras' hydropower plants are revised again, as last year's revision did not use the most current data and the firm's privatization is still not complete. Generators worry their revenues may drop and are fighting changes in the rule. But some experts say more significant revisions are needed.  Alexandre Street, associate professor in the electrical engineering department of the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro, argues for revisions to nameplate generation every year — not every five years, as the current proposal states — without any limitations to how much it can be reduced or increased, as this number should reflect the actual state of the country's hydropower capacity. Street admits this ideal revision is impossible now because there are several exceptions that exempt plants from their necessary revisions.  The Covid-19 pandemic would have been a good time to try to implement these changes, he said, as the sector tried to find ways to cut costs.","['<p class=""lead"">Brazil\'s proposal to revise hydroelectric power plant nameplate generation capacity is necessary to gaining a more realistic view of the grid matrix, but more changes may be needed.</p>', ""<p>Hydroelectric plants' nameplate generation is defined by the mines and energy ministry when first granting their concessions.

"Industry, political narratives clash on oil growth",11 April 2022,None,"A US energy policy debate under way in Washington involves Republicans saying that President Joe Biden's policies have made producers reluctant to invest more capital, while Democrats say the industry has a duty to consumers to allocate recent ""windfall"" profits into more output rather than shareholder returns. The answer from the oil industry can be summed up as ""it's complicated"". US shale producers have repeatedly resisted calls to ramp up supply faster following a spike in crude prices caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, saying it would take the blessing of shareholders to redirect capital. But executives testifying before US Congress last week also cautioned that a faster pace of production growth would be harder to accomplish in any case, citing severe cost pressures, supply chain issues and labour shortages that continue to pose significant challenges. US crude production in February was estimated at 11.8mn b/d, 1.8mn b/d more than when Biden took office but still short of the record 13.1mn b/d before the pandemic hit in early 2020. The sector's focus on prioritising investor returns has drawn criticism from the White House and congressional Democrats. The House of Representatives Energy and Commerce Committee on 6 April pressed oil executives from ExxonMobil, Chevron, Pioneer Natural Resources and Devon Energy, as well as BP and Shell, to consider a dip in shareholder returns to provide some relief to consumers at the pump. The top executives testifying at the hearing said that they plan to raise production this year. But they declined to commit to redirect dividends and stock buybacks estimated at a collective $95bn in 2021 and 2022 into more drilling or clean energy. For Pioneer chief executive Scott Sheffield, ""the answer is no on dividends"", a sentiment echoed by his shale peer at Devon, Rick Muncrief. The hearing comes as the industry gears up to report first-quarter results that will show the benefits from surging energy prices. ExxonMobil, the biggest US producer, has already said that the rally will lift its upstream earnings by as much as $2.7bn over the final quarter of 2021. The industry view provides an alternative to the competing political narratives in Washington over whether oil companies share responsibility for US gasoline prices hitting a record high last month. ""We are here to get answers from the big oil companies about why they are ripping off the American people — at a time of record profits, Big Oil is refusing to increase production,"" committee chairman Frank Pallone says. Republicans are seeking to pin responsibility on the run-up in gasoline and diesel prices on Biden, who in his first year in office blocked the 830,000 b/d Keystone XL pipeline and slow-walked energy leasing on federal land. Devon is now running 19 rigs, up from 14 last year, and plans to bring on 300 new wells in 2022. Additional ramping up is ""challenging"" given the inflationary climate, Muncrief says. The company has spent 110pc of operating cash flow in the past decade, and now is the time to reward shareholders that had stuck with the company during the bad times, he says. Besides capital discipline and sparse funding from private equity and banks, ""the reasons why we can't grow faster are we're lacking rigs, we're lacking frac [hydraulic fracturing] fleets"", Sheffield says.  The decommissioning of rigs and frac fleets that took place in 2020 when prices were low, as well as the unwillingness of workers laid off during recent downturns to return to the shale patch, are additional obstacles, he says — ""when you go through three downturns, we can't bring people back to the Permian basin. Who wants to come back and work in the oil and gas industry?"" Weather-related disruptions, particularly in the Permian early in the year, may weigh on the results of shale explorers. ""We may see the numbers on the lower end of guidance, at least on the production side, but to some extent, also on the capital side,"" consultancy Rystad Energy's head of shale research Artem Abramov says. Analysts at US firm Bernstein Research also flag evidence of strong capital discipline and a lack of prime acreage inventory, as well as the possibility of greater supply-related constraints than anticipated.  Private-sector drillers led the charge back to drilling last year, but they face the same headwinds from higher prices and labour shortages as their public-sector peers. The upshot is that any production response to higher prices may take longer to filter through. But some public-sector producers may end up increasing rig activity in the second half of the year beyond what they originally set out, Rystad says, paving the way for higher growth next year. Chevron intends to spend 60pc more capital than last year but can still return value to shareholders, chief executive Mike Wirth says. Some of the executives testifying before Congress said they felt irony in criticism about their drilling plans — just six months ago, a climate-focused congressional hearing featured Democrats urging the industry to cut production. ""Less than six months ago, I was asked to pledge to reduce production,"" Wirth says. ""I resisted that request and pledged to increase production. I reiterate that pledge today, we will increase our production."" Some Democratic lawmakers pushed back against industry complaints of over-regulation by referencing a recent survey by the Dallas Fed — nearly 60pc of oil executives surveyed said investor pressure for capital discipline was the top reason for restrained growth, with only 10pc blaming government regulations. ""They are very much opposed to large-scale production increases, because who knows what the price might do in a couple of years,"" Dallas Fed senior economic policy advisor Lutz Kilian says. ""That means oil companies in turn cannot afford to go against the wishes of their investors."" Democrats say that as private businesses, oil companies have a right to focus on shareholder returns but do so at the risk of losing preferential tax treatment worth more than $4bn/yr. Democrats are also proposing windfall profit taxes against the industry, the repeal of tax benefits, penalties for not using drilling permits and providing regulators with more power to investigate energy prices. On the Senate side, the Democrats are calling on federal regulators to investigate ""volatile and elevated"" gasoline, diesel and other petroleum product prices on the west coast. Senate Commerce Committee chair Maria Cantwell is crafting new legislation to grant federal anti-trust regulator the FTC greater authority to oversee oil and gasoline spot markets. Pointing to the expanded powers that federal energy regulator Ferc received from Congress in 2005 over the gas and power markets, Cantwell says: ""We now need to do the same thing on opaque petroleum markets."" In the absence of a clear response from the industry to political nudges and price incentives over faster production growth, the Biden White House is continuing to tap the country's Strategic Petroleum Reserve and encouraging allies to do the same. The IEA member countries plan to release 60mn bl of crude over a six-month period, complementing Biden's ordered drawdown of 120mn bl from the US' emergency stocks. It is the fifth time that the IEA has co-ordinated a stocks release and has come about ""in response to the significant strains in oil markets resulting from Russia's invasion of Ukraine"", the agency says — the previous release, of over 60mn bl, was announced just over a month ago. By Stephen Cunningham and Chris Knight      ","['<p class=""lead"">A US energy policy debate under way in Washington involves Republicans saying that President Joe Biden\'s policies have made producers reluctant to invest more capital, while Democrats say the industry has a duty to consumers to allocate recent ""windfall"" profits into more output rather than shareholder returns. The answer from the oil industry can be summed up as ""it\'s complicated"".</p>', ""<p>US shale producers have repeatedly resisted calls to ramp up supply faster following a spike in crude prices caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, saying it would take the blessing of shareholders to redirect capital. But executives testifying before US Congress last week also cautioned that a faster pace of production growth would be harder to accomplish in any case, citing severe cost pressures, supply chain issues and labour shortages that continue to pose significant challenges. US crude production in February was estimated at 11.8mn b/d, 1.8mn b/d more than when Biden took office but still short of the record 13.1mn b/d before the pandemic hit in early 2020.</p>"", ""<p>The sector's focus on prioritising investor returns has drawn criticism from the White House and congressional Democrats. The House of Representatives Energy and Commerce Committee on 6 April pressed oil executives from ExxonMobil, Chevron, Pioneer Natural Resources and Devon Energy, as well as BP and Shell, to consider a dip in shareholder returns to provide some relief to consumers at the pump. The top executives testifying at the hearing said that they plan to raise production this year. But they declined to commit to redirect dividends and stock buybacks estimated at a collective $95bn in 2021 and 2022 into more drilling or clean energy.</p>"", '<p>For Pioneer chief executive Scott Sheffield, ""the answer is no on dividends"", a sentiment echoed by his shale peer at Devon, Rick Muncrief. The hearing comes as the industry gears up to report first-quarter results that will show the benefits from surging energy prices. ExxonMobil, the biggest US producer, has already said that the rally will lift its upstream earnings by as much as $2.7bn over the final quarter of 2021.</p>', '<p class=""lead"">The industry view provides an alternative to the competing political narratives in Washington over whether oil companies share responsibility for US gasoline prices hitting a record high last month. ""We are here to get answers from the big oil companies about why they are ripping off the American people — at a time of record profits, Big Oil is refusing to increase production,"" committee chairman Frank Pallone says. Republicans are seeking to pin responsibility on the run-up in gasoline and diesel prices on Biden, who in his first year in office blocked the 830,000 b/d Keystone XL pipeline and slow-walked energy leasing on federal land.</p>', '<p>Devon is now running 19 rigs, up from 14 last year, and plans to bring on 300 new wells in 2022.

Voestalpine to sell stake in US HBI plant,11 April 2022,By Rye Druzin,"Austria-based steelmaker Voestalpine is in advanced negotiations to sell an 80pc stake in its Corpus Christi, Texas, hot briquetted iron (HBI) plant.  The company will look to retain a certain volume of HBI from the 2mn metric tonnes (t)/yr (2.2mn short tons/yr) Corpus Christi plant for use in decarbonizing its integrated steel plants in Linz and Donawitz, Austria.  HBI is an iron ore-based metallic feedstock used by electric arc furnace (EAF) and some integrated steelmaking operations. Voestalpine began operations at the Corpus Christi facility in October 2016. The potential buyer was not named. EAF steelmaker Steel Dynamics (SDI) recently started up its new 3mn st/yr flat-rolled mill in Sinton, Texas, less than 20 miles northwest of Voestalpine's HBI plant. Integrated steelmaker US Steel is also building a new 3mn st/yr flat-rolled mill in Blytheville, Arkansas, 700 miles northeast of Voestalpine's plant, which could be fed by barge traffic from Corpus Christi.  Voestalpine was forced to write down $190.5mn in value on the HBI plant in mid-2021, citing the deteriorating HBI spot market compared to the scrap and iron ore price ratio during the Covid-19 pandemic. In November, chief financial officer Robert Ottel said demand had improved and the company expected further benefits from increased US EAF steel production with new steel mills being built.  In December, Voestalpine paid $16.8mn to settle a class-action lawsuit over damage caused by dust from its Corpus Christi plant. The company denied all allegations and any violations of the law asserted by the plaintiffs despite reaching a settlement.","['<p class=""lead"">Austria-based steelmaker Voestalpine is in advanced negotiations to sell an 80pc stake in its Corpus Christi, Texas, hot briquetted iron (HBI) plant. </p>', '<p>The company will look to retain a certain volume of HBI from the 2mn metric tonnes (t)/yr (2.2mn short tons/yr) Corpus Christi plant for use in decarbonizing its integrated steel plants in Linz and Donawitz, Austria. </p>', '<p>HBI is an iron ore-based metallic feedstock used by electric arc furnace (EAF) and some integrated steelmaking operations.

Texas border inspections delay trade,11 April 2022,By Jens Erik Gould,"Mexican truckers transporting goods to the US are suffering tripled wait times at the border after Texas directed state troopers to increase inspections. Some commercial vehicles arriving the US at the Colombia bridge near Laredo, Texas, have had to wait as many as three days to cross, while normally they would pass the same day, said Oscar Ortiz, director at northern Mexico trucking company Grupo Omega. ""There are a lot of delays,"" Ortiz told Argus. The increased delays began on 7 April after Texas governor Greg Abbott called for increased security at the state's southern border as the Biden administration ends a pandemic-related health order that allowed US officials to turn away migrants. Abbott directed the Texas Department of Public Safety to ramp up inspections of vehicles crossing international ports of entry ahead of what Texas said would be a ""significant rise in cartel-facilitated smuggling via unsafe vehicles,"" according to Abbott's office. ""Texas will immediately begin taking unprecedented action to do what no state has done in American history to secure our border,"" Abbott said. Ortiz of Grupo Omega confirmed that the additional inspections were being carried out by Texas state officials and not by federal Customs and Border Protection agents, who are normally in charge of inspecting trucks at border crossings. Mexican truckers, who are already dealing with low staffing levels and supply chain challenges, said the increased delays are affecting their productivity and causing customers to receive their products late. He added that the situation is causing bottlenecks at the Laredo border crossings. ""If you could do two or three crossings a day before, you can only do one now,"" Ortiz said. He added that the delays are more challenging now than those experienced at the height of the pandemic because there is increased demand now.  The increased inspections also come as Mexican truckers are dealing with fuel shortages in northern Mexico. ""We cannot get fuel at our normal providers, so we have to go to different providers,"" Ortiz said. US fuel consumers, particularly from southern Texas, have also been crossing into Mexico to fill their tanks given the southern country's continued fuel subsidies, which have been stronger in the US-border area than in the rest of the country. President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador already used the gap in prices to tout his administration's strategy for maintaining lower fuel prices, as he recently showed how gasoline prices in Ciudad Juarez were 10pc lower than in Texas.","['<p class=""lead"">Mexican truckers transporting goods to the US are suffering tripled wait times at the border after Texas directed state troopers to increase inspections.</p>', '<p>Some commercial vehicles arriving the US at the Colombia bridge near Laredo, Texas, have had to wait as many as three days to cross, while normally they would pass the same day, said Oscar Ortiz, director at northern Mexico trucking company Grupo Omega.</p>', '<p>""There are a lot of delays,"" Ortiz told <i>Argus</i>.</p>', ""<p>The increased delays began on 7 April after Texas governor Greg Abbott called for increased security at the state's southern border as the Biden administration ends a pandemic-related health order that allowed US officials to turn away migrants.</p>"", '<p>Abbott directed the Texas Department of Public Safety to ramp up inspections of vehicles crossing international ports of entry ahead of what Texas said would be a ""significant rise in cartel-facilitated smuggling via unsafe vehicles,"" according to Abbott\'s office.</p>', '<p>""Texas will immediately begin taking unprecedented action to do what no state has done in American history to secure our border,"" Abbott said.</p>', '<p>Ortiz of Grupo Omega confirmed that the additional inspections were being carried out by Texas state officials and not by federal Customs and Border Protection agents, who are normally in charge of inspecting trucks at border crossings.</p>', '<p>Mexican truckers, who are already dealing with low staffing levels and supply chain challenges, said the increased delays are affecting their productivity and causing customers to receive their products late.

Brazil expects low thermal dispatch for 2022,11 April 2022,By Rebecca Gompertz,"Brazil expects to keep thermal dispatch this year much lower than last year, enabling the use of the lowest cost power sources, except for some higher cost emergency power that was contracted during last year's drought, according to grid operator ONS. Thermal dispatch will average of 4,000-6,500MW for the rest of 2022, according to ONS, compared with a peak average last year of 20,000MW. The 2022 forecast includes 775.8MW contracted last year during an emergency power auction, before the country's water storage for hydro power was replenished. Market participants criticized the auction for inflexible contracts that require thermal plants to dispatch contracted power regardless of the cost. The auction had an average unitary cost of power of R1,619/MWh ($340.75/MWh) for natural gas plants. Currently, with heavy rains in the first quarter of the year, the Brazil power calculated spot price is R55.70/MWh. After an unusually wet rainy season, Brazil's reservoir levels have recovered to well above last year, when an historic drought led to a power crisis in the country. ONS expects to reach an average water storage level for the country at 40-61pc of the long-term average by the end of November — the end of Brazil's dry season. Southeastern and mid-center region reservoirs, the most significant ones in the country, are expected to reach levels at 40-63pc of average. The grid operator does not anticipate it will need to dispatch power outside of the computer-calculated ""merit order"" for price — dispatching from the cheaper source up to the most expensive one, until demand is met — for the rest of the year. ONS also expects to maintain the current lowest surcharge rate for regulated power market consumers for the rest of the year. The government recently announced a reduction in surcharges for regulated market power consumers effective on 15 April. The extra charges dates to mid-2021 to cover costs of thermal power generation needed to complement last year's drought-stricken hydropower generation. The measure is expected to reduce domestic consumers' power bills by 20pc in this election year, and a R10.5bn loan is already in place to cover part of those extra charges, with payments due to start in 2023, under the next federal administration.","['<p class=""lead"">Brazil expects to keep thermal dispatch this year much lower than last year, enabling the use of the lowest cost power sources, except for some higher cost emergency power that was contracted during last year\'s drought, according to grid operator ONS.</p>', '<p>Thermal dispatch will average of 4,000-6,500MW for the rest of 2022, according to ONS, compared with a peak average last year of 20,000MW.</p>', '<p>The 2022 forecast includes 775.8MW contracted last year during <a href=""https://direct.argusmedia.com/newsandanalysis/article/2268732"">an emergency power auction</a>, before the country\'s water storage for hydro power was replenished.

US voluntary CO2 markets poised for improved liquidity,11 April 2022,By Jessica Dell,"Voluntary carbon markets could realize greater liquidity as US regulators move toward mandating corporate carbon disclosures and other governing bodies move to bolster the integrity of carbon credits.  Increasing integrity in carbon markets will bolster confidence and encourage investments, market stakeholders said last week at the North American Carbon World conference in Anaheim, California. ""Well-meaning companies"" are resistant to engaging in voluntary carbon markets because they fear buying a credit that is viewed as ""not good enough,"" said Annett Nazareth, co-chair of the Integrity Council for Voluntary Carbon Markets. This is where ""help is on the way."" The Integrity Council, an independent governance body for the voluntary carbon market, will launch a public consultation process in May as it strives to ensure high-quality carbon credits meet certain standards, and to ensure credits trade in high-integrity, transparent markets, Nazareth said. The council aims to make sure the credits are universally accepted for purchases. US regulators also are taking steps to improve the integrity of carbon markets.  Publicly traded companies would have to disclose granular data about their greenhouse gas emissions and related financial risks, under a landmark proposal from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). If a company has plans for reducing emissions through carbon offsets, they would also need to disclose that. The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has been accepting input on ways to support the growth of climate-related financial products, another sign of the wave of activity from US financial regulators, who say steps on climate risk are needed for the financial system. These efforts are imperative to develop thresholds that everyone can trust in the market, International Emissions Trading Association (IETA) chief executive Dirk Forrister said. Greater trust could boost the markets that support climate action, he said.  ""Getting [this market] to scale is about getting investor confidence,"" Forrister said. ""The SEC rulemaking that has begun, the CFTC rattling their saber on whether it needs to get involved – we might have a carbon market driven by financial regulation rather than by traditional environmental regulation."" The work by the SEC could increase demand for voluntary offsets, particularly for those of ""higher-quality"" because the offset procurement would be made public, several market participants told Argus at the conference. Companies would be reluctant to buy offsets of more dubious quality, hiking demand — and the price — for higher quality offsets.  The market so far has been fragmented, with certain types of projects commanding much higher premiums over others, hindering moves toward the standardization that many stakeholders have sought.  Organizations that set the environmental standards for offset projects are largely embracing moves toward greater oversight and standardization, which could help protect buyers against accusations of ""greenwashing.""  ""There are too many credits out there where the standards are ambiguous,"" Climate Action Reserve president Craig Elbert said. ""It is going to require vigilance on all of our parts to make sure that the structure is set up properly."" Carbon markets evolving toward a model of third-party assessment and independent verification is a positive development, Verra chief executive David Antonolini said.

The USDA increased its global palm oil production forecast for the October 2021-September 2022 marketing year to 77.05mn t, up from 75.59mn t in its March report. Output reached 73.11mn t during the 2020-21 marketing year, according to USDA data. The expected return of migrant workers to relieve Malaysia's plantation labour shortage boosted Malaysian production projections for 2021-22 to 19mn t, up from 18.7mn t forecast in March.  Indonesian production for 2021-22 was revised up to 45.5mn t from 44.5mn t in March, with milder climatic conditions forecast for the key Indonesian palm oil growing regions of Kalimantan and south Sumatra.  The USDA sees increased Chinese buying driving an expansion in palm oil trade. Chinese imports for 2021-22 are forecast up to 7.1mn t from 6.7mn t in the March report and against 6.82mn t received in 2020-21, as China moves to bolster dwindling vegetable oil stocks through imports with weaker soybean crushing margins.  But higher sales prices and Indonesian export tariffs for palm oil continue to limit Indian imports compared with a year previously, with a shift in demand towards soft oils in the price-sensitive market. The USDA kept its Indian palm oil import forecast for 2021-22 flat from March at 7.75mn t in the April report, down from 8.41mn t recorded in 2020-21.  Indonesia is now expected to end 2021-22 with palm oil stocks at 7mn t, up from 6.5mn t in the March USDA forecast and 5.98mn t in 2020-21. Malaysian ending stocks are forecast up to 1.82mn t, up from the 1.62mn t prediction in March and at the end of 2020-21.

Australian government plans new LNG terminal in Darwin,12 April 2022,By Kevin Morrison,"The Australian conservative coalition government today pledged to spend up to A$1.5bn ($1.12bn) to build a LNG export terminal as part of new port infrastructure at Darwin in the Northern Territory (NT). The plan includes additional facilities to manage hydrogen exports and critical mineral processing, as well as refinery capabilities. The pledge is based on the coalition winning the 21 May federal election.  The Liberal-National party coalition government sold the existing Darwin port, which includes export terminals for the 3.7mn t/yr Darwin LNG and 8.9mn t/yr Ichthys LNG plants, to Chinese infrastructure and energy group Landbridge in 2016. Trade and political relations between Australia and China have soured since the Landbridge deal, and Australia has attempted to tighten rules around the sale of strategic assets to China.  ""Our investment will deliver this, supporting port infrastructure, including a wharf and offloading facility, and dredging of the shipping channel,"" Australian deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce said in Darwin where he was campaigning for next month's election. There is no guarantee that the LNG terminal will be built as many promises are made in the heat of an election campaign. The viability of another LNG export terminal at Darwin would also depend on finding economic gas reserves. The coalition government is very keen for upstream firms to undertake more exploration work in the onshore Beetaloo basin in the NT. Early-stage geological work has estimated significant gas resources within the Beetaloo basin, which is around 600km southeast of Darwin.","['<p class=""lead"">The Australian conservative coalition government today pledged to spend up to A$1.5bn ($1.12bn) to build a LNG export terminal as part of new port infrastructure at Darwin in the Northern Territory (NT).</p>', '<p>The plan includes additional facilities to manage hydrogen exports and critical mineral processing, as well as refinery capabilities.

Donges refinery workers vote on whether to stop strike,12 April 2022,By Adam Porter,"Workers at TotalEnergies' 222,000 b/d Donges refinery in northwest France will vote today on whether to end strike action following a dispute over the use of fixed-term contracts.  TotalEnergies has refused to negotiate. Workers at the plant say they ""will continue to fight to financially undermine TotalEnergies"", without specifying any actions or timeframe. Donges has not processed any crude since December 2020. It was shut down on economic grounds and then stayed closed for an extended turnaround, which began last autumn. The work included repairs to a cracked crude pipeline. TotalEnergies had planned to resume operations after the turnaround on 11 March, but that was missed. Two crude tankers that were slated to discharge at Donges in March and April diverted away from the refinery, both going to Le Havre instead. Aframax tanker the Lancing was carrying around 450,000 bl of North Sea Ekofisk and the Alfa Finlandia had a similar-sized cargo of Libyan grade Bouri. Both discharged at Le Havre where TotalEnergies has its 240,000 b/d Gonfreville refinery. A third tanker, the Eagle Barcelona, is now signalling arrival with a 500,000 bl cargo of US WTI crude loaded at Corpus Christi. But it is not slated to arrive until 26 April. Workers at the plant say crude tanks are empty, suggesting that a restart may be unlikely before the turn of the month.","['<p class=""lead"">Workers at TotalEnergies\' 222,000 b/d Donges refinery in northwest France will vote today on whether to end strike action following <a href=""https://direct.argusmedia.com/newsandanalysis/article/2316921"">a dispute over the use of fixed-term contracts.</a> </p>', '<p>TotalEnergies has refused to negotiate.

Pemex HSFO unlikely Russia-US Gulf replacement,12 April 2022,"By Sergio Meana, Kayla Meyertons and Dylan Chase","Mexican state-owned Pemex's overabundance of high sulphur fuel oil (HSFO) may not prove a good replacement for banned Russian fuel oil at US Gulf coast refineries, because of both cost and quality issues. Russian Urals-derived M100 fuel oil regularly makes its way to US refiners as a coker feedstock. In February as much as 53pc of US Gulf coast fuel oil imports came from Russia, according to Vortexa, versus about 24pc from Mexico. In March Russian fuel oil imports rose to 71pc while Mexican imports shrank to only 5pc. But with the US banning all Russian products and crude imports US refiners must look elsewhere to fill that need. Pemex has a surplus of fuel oil, with its six domestic refineries producing more of it than any other product, even gasoline, in 2021, at 244,300 b/d. That is up by 39pc from 2020. But despite this large supply relatively close at hand, more than 50pc of anticipated US Gulf April cargoes are expected to arrive from the Middle East, including countries such as Kuwait, Oman, Saudi Arabia and Iraq, according to Vortexa. Only 6pc, or 13,620 b/d, of April US Gulf coast imports will originate from Mexico, with the remaining 42pc outsourced from pre-ban Russian cargoes. Mexican HSFO lost out to Russian M100 in the past because of Russian tax regime considerations that encouraged Russian companies to export large volumes of VGO and residual feedstocks, Robert Auers, consultant at Turner Mason and Company, told Argus. Pemex HSFO generally also has lower yields of gasoline and gasoil, as Pemex's fuel oil output has more than 0.5pc of sulphur, limiting its ability to place it in other markets or for shipping after the International Maritime Organization's 2020 restrictions on marine fuel oil sulphur levels. Besides the quality, Mexico's geographic proximity appears to be offset by lower freight costs for Middle East shipments. Dirty tanker rates from the Mideast Gulf to the US Gulf coast for 280kt vessels have been 30pc lower on average since 14 March through 11 April, according to Argus assessments, with the Mideast-USGC rate as much as 53pc below the Mexico-USGC rate at $7.08/t versus $10.84/t on 25 March. As of 11 April, the Mideast-USGC rate was 18pc lower than the Mexico-USGC rate, as both increased up to $12.03/t and $14.19/t, respectively. As a result of the ongoing freight disparity, the US Gulf coast may continue to seek Middle Eastern barrels in the near-term over Mexican feedstock to fulfill robust coker economics. This dynamic may shift as Russian pre-ban shipments finalize their arrivals up to 22 April, and the Gulf expands HSFO outlets.","['<p class=""lead"">Mexican state-owned Pemex\'s overabundance of high sulphur fuel oil (HSFO) may not prove a good replacement for banned Russian fuel oil at US Gulf coast refineries, because of both cost and quality issues.</p>', '<p>Russian Urals-derived M100 fuel oil regularly makes its way to US refiners as a coker feedstock.

Japan’s Kanto scrap export tender extends increases,12 April 2022,By Xia Ji,"Japanese scrap dealers' co-operative Kanto Tetsugen's monthly export scrap tender extended gains in April despite waning interest from overseas buyers. The April tender settled at ¥67,010/t ($533/t) fas for 10,000t of H2 grade scrap, equivalent to ¥68,010/t on a fob basis. Only one 10,000t lot was confirmed during the tender, which was the same as the Kanto tender in March. Other failed bids ranged between ¥65,200-66,800/t. The wider range indicated a mixed market outlook, trading participants said. The tender was ¥3,500/t higher than the previous month and is ¥740/t shy of the all-time high at ¥67,750/t in July 2008. The rapid depreciation of the yen against the US dollar throughout March-April supported the increased Kanto tender price. The exchange rate fell by 8.5pc from ¥114.84 on 1 March to ¥125.43 on 12 April. Although the tender result in yen rose by ¥3,500/t from a month earlier, the dollar equivalent price fell by $15/t. ""I heard that this cargo is bought by the same trading company as previous months, so they might be taking a long position again,"" a Japanese trader said. Mill buyers were on the market sidelines from last week after the upside momentum of steel products slowed and some US suppliers cut their offer levels to the Asian market.","['<p class=""lead"">Japanese scrap dealers\' co-operative Kanto Tetsugen\'s monthly export scrap tender extended gains in April despite waning interest from overseas buyers.</p>', '<p>The April tender settled at ¥67,010/t ($533/t) fas for 10,000t of H2 grade scrap, equivalent to ¥68,010/t on a fob basis.

South Korea’s CJ Cheil Jedang to use biomass for steam,12 April 2022,None,"South Korean food manufacturing company CJ Cheil Jedang is planning to build a facility that uses woody biomass to generate steam to operate its food factory at CJ Blossom Campus in Jincheon, Chungcheongbuk-do province. The facility will be able to generate 50 t/hr of steam from gas generated by turning woody biomass into charcoal after applying gasification technology, the company said. The company expects to replace natural gas with biomass for steam generation, and reduce 44,000 t/yr of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions produced at its factory once the facility begins commercial operations. Construction will start from next year and commercial operations are scheduled to begin in 2025.  The company did not specify what type of woody biomass will be used or how much the facility plans to use annually.

Inpasa amplia produção de etanol de milho,12 April 2022,Por Karina Tarasiuk e Vinicius Damazio,"O grupo Inpasa pretende investir R$1 bilhão para expandir sua usina de etanol de milho em Nova Mutum, em Mato Grosso, o estado com maior produção de milho do Brasil. A usina da empresa está a caminho de dobrar sua capacidade anual de processamento de milho em comparação com o volume atual de 1 milhão de t de milho anualmente. Isso elevará a capacidade de produção de etanol hidratado da usina para 900.000 m³/ano ante a produção atual de 546.000 m³/ano. Além da oferta do biocombustível, a usina da Inpasa terá a capacidade de produzir 48.000 m³/ano de óleo de milho destilado e 480.000 m³/ano de grãos secos por destilação (DDGs, na sigla em inglês) até o fim do primeiro semestre de 2023, quando o projeto será concluído. A obra de expansão está prevista para começar em maio, mas ainda está sujeita à aprovação de órgãos ambientais. A usina de etanol de milho da empresa em Nova Mutum começou suas operações em julho de 2020. No ano passado, a Inpasa expandiu sua primeira usina de etanol em Sinop, aumentando a capacidade anual de moagem de milho em 1 milhão de t/ano e a produção de etanol em 470.000 m³/ano. A empresa espera ter capacidade total de moagem de milho de 4,4 milhões de t/ano e capacidade de produção de etanol de 2 milhões de m³/ano até o começo de 2023. A empresa também planeja começar as operações de uma terceira usina de etanol de milho em Mato Grosso do Sul. A usina deve começar suas operações em junho. O Brasil depende há muito tempo da cana-de-açúcar como matéria-prima para processamento de etanol, mas o biocombustível à base de milho expandiu sua participação no mix de produção do país nos últimos anos, principalmente pelo aumento da capacidade de produção concentrada no Centro-Oeste, espalhada pelos estados de Mato Grosso e Goiás. A produção em ambos os estados supera amplamente a demanda interna. A preferência pelo hidratado vendido entre os produtores de etanol à base de milho é amparada por incentivos fiscais para transferências interestaduais de biocombustíveis de Mato Grosso. O Mato Grosso tem a maior capacidade instalada de etanol de milho e oferece aos produtores a restituição do ICMS estadual para vendas de hidratado destinadas a outros estados.","['<p class=""lead"">O grupo Inpasa pretende investir R$1 bilhão para expandir sua usina de etanol de milho em Nova Mutum, em Mato Grosso, o estado com maior produção de milho do Brasil.</p>', '<p>A usina da empresa está a caminho de dobrar sua capacidade anual de processamento de milho em comparação com o volume atual de 1 milhão de t de milho anualmente.

"US HRC: Prices flat, market pauses",12 April 2022,None,"US hot-rolled coil (HRC) prices paused for the first time since the beginning of March as the market digested a weaker-than-expected scrap trade. The Argus weekly domestic US HRC Midwest and southern assessments were both flat at $1,500/st. Both prices are up by 47pc since hitting a low around $1,022/st on 1 March. HRC lead times in the Midwest rose slightly to 6-7 weeks from 5-6 weeks, as mills were said to be booking for late-May or beginning to cross over into June. HRC offers were heard mostly at $1,500/st, with some heard on either side of that mark. The US prime scrap market traded up $75/gross ton in the April trade, a historically large increase, but below some expectations that prices would increase $100/gt or more.  The weaker than expected scrap trade combined with flat pig iron prices tempered pricing expectations in the finished steel market. Austrian steelmaker Voestalpine is in advanced negotiations to sell an 80pc stake in its 2.2mn st/yr hot briquetted iron (HBI) plant in Corpus Christi, Texas. No buyer was announced, though electric arc furnace (EAF) steelmaker Steel Dynamics (SDI) recently opened its 3mn st/yr flat-rolled mill 20 miles from the HBI plant, and US Steel operates the Big River Steel EAF mill in Osceola, Arkansas, 700 miles away.  The spread between #1 busheling delivered US Midwest consumer and pig iron cfr New Orleans narrowed to $276/st. HRC import prices into Houston were flat at $1,543/st ddp as import offers into the US were limited. The spread between #1 busheling scrap delivered US Midwest mills and HRC selling prices fell by 3.6pc to $859/st. A year ago the spread was $828/st. The spread between pig iron cfr New Orleans and Midwest and southern HRC prices were flat at $584/st. The Argus weekly domestic US cold-rolled coil (CRC) and hot dipped galvanized (HDG) coil assessments were flat at $1,900/st. Lead times for CRC were at eight weeks compared to 7-9 weeks while HDG lead times slipped to 7-8 weeks from 7-9 weeks. The CME HRC Midwest futures market dropped sharply in the last week as sentiment weakened. May futures pricing plunged by $120/st to $1,475/st compared to the last week, while June pricing dropped by $111/st to $1,435/st. July future pricing fell by $105/st to $1,405/st, while August futures plumetted by $124/st to $1,366/st. September futures dropped by $94/st to $1,336/st, while October futures fell by $57/st to $1,298/st. The Argus weekly domestic US ex-works plate assessment was flat at $1,910/st, as was the plate delivered assessment at $2,013/st.

Australia's Oceania Biofuels plans Gladstone SAF plant,13 April 2022,By Kevin Morrison,"Australian privately-owned firm Oceania Biofuels is planning a A$500mn ($373mn) renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) biorefinery in Gladstone, Queensland in eastern Australia, according to the Queensland state government. The plant will use locally-sourced waste and sustainable feedstock — such as tallow, canola and used cooking oil (UCO) — to produce more than 350mn litres/yr (6,100 b/d) of SAF and renewable diesel, Oceania Biofuels' chief executive officer Mike Everton said. Construction of the plant will start in Gladstone in 2023, Everton added. The plant is to be built at the industrial precinct of Yarwun, where another biofuel plant is already in operation and is operated by Australian privately-owned firm Northern Oil. Australia's Qantas Airways last month set a target of using SAF for 10pc of its jet fuel mix by 2030, and around 60pc by 2050, when the airline plans to hit net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.","['<p class=""lead"">Australian privately-owned firm Oceania Biofuels is planning a A$500mn ($373mn) renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) biorefinery in Gladstone, Queensland in eastern Australia, according to the Queensland state government.</p>', ""<p>The plant will use locally-sourced waste and sustainable feedstock — such as tallow, canola and used cooking oil (UCO) — to produce more than 350mn litres/yr (6,100 b/d) of SAF and renewable diesel, Oceania Biofuels' chief executive officer Mike Everton said.</p>"", '<p>Construction of the plant will start in Gladstone in 2023, Everton added.

"China lockdowns, SPR draw to offset Russian loss: IEA",13 April 2022,By James Keates,"The IEA has cut its global oil demand growth forecast for this year on the back of Covid-19 lockdowns in China. This, together with a record emergency stocks release from the US and other IEA member countries, will help offset disruptions to Russian supply and should prevent a sharp deficit from developing, the Paris-based energy watchdog said today in its latest Oil Market Report (OMR). The IEA maintains that sanctions and self-imposed embargoes will have a severe impact on Russian oil output, although the 3mn b/d loss that it predicted last month may take a month longer to materialise. ""So far in April, roughly 700,000 b/d of [Russian] production has reportedly been shut in. We assume these losses will grow to an average 1.5mn b/d for the month as Russian refiners extend run cuts, more buyers shun barrels and Russian storage fills up,"" the IEA said. ""From May onwards, close to 3mn b/d of Russian production could be offline due to international sanctions and as the impact of a widening customer-driven embargo comes into full force."" As Russia's traditional customers cut back on purchases, some buyers in Asia are stepping in to take advantage of sharply discounted prices, helping to reallocate some of the trade flows. But there are no signs at the moment that increased Russian volumes are going to China, the IEA said. Chinese oil demand has been dented by a recent surge in Covid cases and a wave of lockdowns across the country.  This has underpinned a 240,000 b/d cut in the IEA's forecast for this year's global oil demand growth, to 1.87mn b/d from 2.11mn b/d in last month's OMR. Beijing's measures to control the spread of Covid cases have been more stringent than the IEA expected, prompting the agency to revise down its forecast for Chinese oil demand by 730,000 b/d for March, 925,000 b/d for April and 690,000 b/d for May. The reduction in demand growth will be outpaced by Russian supply disruption, and this is why the IEA's latest stocks release provides such ""a crucial buffer"" to oil markets, the agency said. The IEA announced a co-ordinated 120mn bl release on 1 April. Together with a wider drawdown from the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR), a total of around 240mn bl of emergency oil stocks will be made available over the next six months. ""The record volumes will provide welcome relief to an already tight oil market that's facing heightened uncertainty amid the multitude of repercussions stemming from sanctions and embargoes targeted at Russia by the international community and consumer boycotts,"" the IEA said, noting that crude futures prices have dropped by nearly $10/bl since the stocks release announcements were made. Excluding Russia, the IEA expects global oil production to rise by 5.5mn b/d this year, with 3.5mn b/d of the growth coming from Opec+ and 2mn b/d from outside the Opec+ group. It forecasts that the US will account for more than 60pc of the non-Opec+ expansion.","['<p class=""lead"">The IEA has cut its global oil demand growth forecast for this year on the back of Covid-19 lockdowns in China.

"India’s FY21-22 auto sales hurt by chip, cost woes",13 April 2022,By Sumita Layek,"India's automobile sales dropped in the financial year 2021-22, weighed down by supply-side challenges and the rising cost of vehicles, while production was little changed. Automobile sales during April 2021-March 2022 fell by 6pc on the year to 17.5mn units, while output rose by 1pc on an annual basis to 22.9mn, according to the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (Siam). In March, auto sales declined by nearly 18pc on the year to 1.5mn and output dropped by 17.3pc against the previous year to 1.96mn, Siam data showed. ""Mass segments like two-wheelers and smaller cars are facing serious affordability issues,"" Siam's president Kenichi Ayukawa said, adding semiconductor availability continued to remain a challenge for the sector. Record-high steel prices, a shortage of semiconductor chips and rising fuel costs in the past year amid the pandemic has battered the automobile industry. The Indian steel industry receives 8-10pc of its demand from the auto sector. India's largest car manufacturer Maruti Suzuki earlier this month announced it will hike prices in April for its vehicles because of the increase in various input costs. India's Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations (Fada) sees the recent geopolitical tensions and the lockdowns in China further adding to the supply-side issues, and expects higher vehicle costs and elevated crude prices to act as a deterrent to demand. Total auto sales rose by 7.2pc on the year to 16.4mn units in the financial year, but remained about 25pc lower than pre-pandemic financial year 2019-20, according to Fada. ""We anticipate that [the] auto industry may come out of the woods and reach pre-pandemic highs by FY2024,"" Fada said.","['<p class=""lead"">India\'s automobile sales dropped in the financial year 2021-22, weighed down by supply-side challenges and the rising cost of vehicles, while production was little changed.</p>', '<p>Automobile sales during April 2021-March 2022 fell by 6pc on the year to 17.5mn units, while output rose by 1pc on an annual basis to 22.9mn, according to the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (Siam).</p>', '<p>In March, auto sales declined by nearly 18pc on the year to 1.5mn and output dropped by 17.3pc against the previous year to 1.96mn, Siam data showed.</p>', '<p>""Mass segments like two-wheelers and smaller cars are facing serious affordability issues,"" Siam\'s president Kenichi Ayukawa said, adding semiconductor availability continued to remain a challenge for the sector.</p>', '<p><a href=""https://direct.argusmedia.com/newsandanalysis/article/2315480"">Record-high steel prices</a>, a shortage of semiconductor chips and rising fuel costs in the past year amid the pandemic has battered the automobile industry.

China’s March steel exports fall on year,13 April 2022,None,"China's steel exports in March fell by 34.4pc on the year to 4.945mn t, as global steel demand weakens and Chinese domestic crude steel output falls.  March steel exports were up by 20.1pc from the average monthly export volumes of the first two months of this year. China's general administration of customs released combined January and February data to smooth out the effects of the lunar new year holiday, that typically falls during that period. Most March steel export shipments were spot orders taken in mid-December 2021 and January, when prices in China and the overseas market were on a downward trend.  The winter season in China from November to February typically sees weaker construction steel consumption. Shanghai rebar ex-warehouse prices assessed by Argus fell by 130 yuan/t ($20.42/t) to Yn4,690/t from 15 December to 31 January. Shanghai hot-rolled coil (HRC) ex-warehouse prices, which are less affected by construction steel demand, rose by Yn40/t to Yn4,940/t over the same period.  Chinese domestic steel output was also on a downward trend in winter. China's winter restriction plan for mills in north China's ""2+26"" cities requires an overall cut of 30pc on the year from January until mid-March. China's total crude steel output in January-February fell by 10pc on the year. Major steel mills cut export volumes as a result of falling steel output.  Chinese steel export prices lost its advantage over other major exporters in the seaborne market. Chinese rebar export prices maintained a premium of $30-40/t over Turkish rebar in December and January, attracting slim purchasing interest from major southeast Asian markets including Hong Kong and Singapore.  But Chinese steel exports in April and May are predicted to pick up as the Russia-Ukraine conflict drives up international steel prices sharply. Chinese mills also took advantage of the supply gap after sanctions were imposed on Russian supplies. Major Chinese HRC producers have sold out their flat steel export orders for May shipments in March, according to Argus' surveys.

CPC Blend crude exports to rebound in May,13 April 2022,By Felix Todd,"Exports of Capsian light sour CPC Blend crude are set to recover next month following disruption to this month's programme caused by storm damage at the grade's Black Sea loading terminal.  The preliminary May schedule puts exports at about 1.42mn b/d next month, up by 5pc from the revised April plan and closer to typical monthly levels.  The Tengizchevroil consortium, which operates Kazakhstan's Tengiz field, is set to raise CPC Blend loadings by 16pc on the month to almost 650,000 b/d in May.

Shanghai bans private cars on roads to stem Covid surge,13 April 2022,None,"China's financial hub of Shanghai will ban all private vehicles on roads except for service cars from 13 April as part of Covid-19 prevention measures, a move that is likely to further cut Chinese transport fuel demand.  The measure is likely to prevent residents from trying to leave the city, especially as train tickets to major adjacent cities are sold out for the next five days after Shanghai announced that it will partly ease lockdown restrictions. This came after it divided areas in the city into three risk categories.  Cases from the city are spreading to multiple Chinese provinces, an official at China's National Health Commission said.  Chinese cities are struggling to contain the spread of the Omicron variant, leading to extended lockdowns and reductions in fuel demand. Gasoline demand is on course to contract by 170,000 b/d in March-April, Argus estimates, which would leave 2022 oil demand 90,000 b/d lower than expected. Some Shanghai residents left the city even during a full lockdown from 1-11 April. A person who tested positive for Covid-19 moved freely within Weinan city in Shaanxi province after arriving from Shanghai on 11 April by hiding their travel history, local Weinan police reported. Weinan requires a two-week centralised isolation period for anyone arriving from cities with medium- to high-risk areas. More than 73pc of the 374 cases from 10 March to 11 April in Suzhou city of Jiangsu province, some 80km from Shanghai by car, were transmitted from Shanghai, according to Gu Haidong, deputy mayor of Suzhou. Suzhou has completed a round Covid-19 testing for its 10mn residents. Suzhou is going through its most severe outbreak in the year with cases spreading in most districts, city authorities said on 13 April. A part of Kunshan, an industrial city in Suzhou with a population of over 2mn, has extended lockdown restrictions by a week to 19 April. Shanghai reported 26,330 local infections on 12 April and city authorities estimate that case numbers will remain high for a while. China is trying to maintain strict Covid-19 restrictions in Shanghai because cases from the city account for over 87pc of total cases so far in April and infections in regions outside Shanghai are reducing or ""mostly under control"", an official at the National Health Commission said.  Residents from places in Shanghai with looser restrictions have been asked to avoid neighbourhood areas. Some areas allow one person from each family to go out once a day using temporary passes, mostly for food supplies. Lockdowns and road closures during the month have significantly disrupted logistics despite China's state council warning that freight trucks should not be arbitrarily restricted from moving. Mail package volumes in Jiangsu have decreased by about 60pc in April and mail services might resume in 1-3 weeks, according to the Jiangsu provincial postal administration.  A trader in east China is concerned that the logistics disruptions will affect material and part deliveries to factories for their production lines, some of which run on diesel. This is likely to further weigh on diesel consumption. Diesel demand is on course to fall by 125,000 b/d in March-April as over 30 Chinese cities have been affected by lockdowns, Argus estimates.","['<p class=""lead"">China\'s financial hub of Shanghai will ban all private vehicles on roads except for service cars from 13 April as part of Covid-19 prevention measures, a move that is likely to further cut Chinese transport fuel demand. </p>', '<p>The measure is likely to prevent residents from trying to leave the city, especially as train tickets to major adjacent cities are sold out for the next five days after Shanghai announced that it will partly ease lockdown restrictions.

Bio-mandates cuts to worsen oil supply security: IEA,13 April 2022,By Giulia Squadrin,"Oil demand and security of supply issues could be exacerbated by any reduction in biofuels mandates, according to the IEA, with biofuels making up around 2pc by volume of world oil demand.  Several countries have reconsidered or adjusted biofuel-blending mandates to reduce end-user energy price tensions following sharp gains to fuel prices at the pumps and increases in biofuels prices amid higher food, fertiliser and feedstocks values due to the conflict in Ukraine. Last week Finland said it will reduce its biofuel mandate, calculated as the percentage of road fuel by energy content coming from renewable sources, for this year and 2023 by 7.5 percentage points to 12pc and 13.5pc respectively. Sweden has also proposed to freeze its mandate for 2023 at 2022 levels and Croatia has withdrawn penalties given to blenders that miss mandate targets. Biofuels market participants told Argus that Austria is considering changes to its blending mandates, but this has yet to be confirmed by the country's ministry of climate action, environment and energy. But while the IEA expects mandate reductions to biofuel mandates to increase challenges for the oil sector, the European Commission said cutting consumption of crop-based biofuels, mineral fertilizers, natural gas and reducing animal feed imports are necessary to increase the EU's food security.

Colombia launches green taxonomy,13 April 2022,None,"The taxonomy aims to attract green finance to the country in its effort to mitigate climate change, writes Jacqueline Echevarria Colombia has launched a green taxonomy that aims to boost green finance in the country. It will help participants in the public and private sectors identify and evaluate investments that can help meet environmental objectives and which are aligned with the country's commitments and policies. The taxonomy, launched by President Ivan Duque on 11 April during a visit to the New York Stock Exchange, focuses on mitigation and adaptation to climate change, conservation of ecosystems and biodiversity, water management, soil management, circular economy and pollution prevention and control. The document outlines seven sectors, assets and economic activities that contribute to the environmental goal of mitigating climate change — energy, construction, waste management and emissions capture, water supply and treatment, transportation, information and communication technologies, and manufacturing. The taxonomy also highlights three sectors of land use — livestock, agriculture and forestry. These sectors together are responsible for 59pc of Colombia's greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, it says. The taxonomy is aimed at helping Colombia meet its goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 51pc by 2030 and hitting carbon neutrality by 2050. The green taxonomy was formulated by the finance ministry with the support of external entities including the World Bank's finance arm IFC. ""The aim was to bring the EU taxonomy to a local context by either dividing a number of activities that were very similar to the EU but also developing some additional details that were fit for the country,"" says the head of the IFC's climate finance programme for Latin America and the Caribbean, Marcela Ponce, who worked on the project.  Other countries in the region are working with the IFC on developing green taxonomies. ""We are also working with the environment ministry in Peru… Chile has started working on defining the governance of a potential taxonomy,"" Ponce adds. ""This is very important for governments because they committed to net zero targets,"" she says.  The taxonomy identifies 18 economic assets and activities in the energy sector that have a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation, from renewable electricity generation to green hydrogen production and district heating. The energy sector generates 10pc of GHG emissions in the country, the document says.  The taxonomy sets some criteria to determine whether an energy investment is green or sustainable. Solar, wind and ocean energy generation are eligible. But for other generation, heating and cooling activities, it is necessary to carry out a GHG life-cycle study. Facilities operating with life-cycle emissions of less than 100g CO2 equivalent/kWh are eligible, the document says. Renewable energy purchase activity is also eligible if it is subject to a long-term power purchase agreement and has a renewable energy certificate.  On hydropower, facilities with a power density of less than 5W/m² must demonstrate that they operate with life-cycle emissions of less than 100g CO2e/kWh. Geothermal or cogeneration facilities have the same threshold.","['<p><i>The taxonomy aims to attract green finance to the country in its effort to mitigate climate change, writes Jacqueline Echevarria</i></p>', '<p class=""lead"">Colombia has launched a green taxonomy that aims to boost green finance in the country.

Cores says Spanish biodiesel demand up in February,13 April 2022,None,"Spanish biodiesel demand rose on the year in February, according to state-controlled strategic reserve Cores. Spain consumed close to 110,000t of biodiesel and hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) in February, flat on the month, up by 8pc on the year, but below the 135,000t consumed in February 2020. The year-on-year growth rate was half that of Spanish diesel demand, which rose by 16pc on the year to 1.78mn t (475,000 b/d), according to Cores. Cores' members are made up of integrated Repsol, BP and refiner Cepsa, plus biodiesel producers, distributors and blenders. Storage firms on the Mediterranean coast are reporting strong regional demand for biofuels, reflected in record throughput at the start of this year at the northeastern port of Barcelona. Cores posted some minor revisions to its 2021 data, with biodiesel and HVO demand at 1.36mn t, down from a slightly higher number in previous estimates. This leaves the 2021 biodiesel target around 1mn t short. In 2020, the target was around 400,000t short, but producers and traders said this could be accounted for by double-counted biodiesel and HVO made from either used cooking oil (Ucome) or animal fats (TME).

US renewable diesel output to rise 75pc this year: EIA,13 April 2022,By Jamuna Gautam,"US renewable diesel (RD) output is forecast to increase by 75pc this year and another 25pc next year, as planned new capacity comes online, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA). RD capacity in 2022 will average 93,000 b/d, up by 40,000 b/d from last year, the EIA predicts. Production for 2023 is expected to average 117,000 b/d. Seaboard Energy's 5,550 b/d RD plant in Hugoton, Kansas, and HollyFrontier's 5,900 b/d RD plant in Cheyenne, Wyoming, came online this year in the first quarter, and at least three other RD facilities are expected to start operations in the second half of this year.  By 2023, Marathon Petroleum plans to convert the idled Martinez refinery in California into a 48,000 b/d RD facility. EIA expects RD consumption to increase this year to 127,000 b/d, up by 51,000 b/d from 2021, with consumption in 2023 reaching 154,000 b/d.  RD net imports were projected to rise from 26,000 b/d last year to 35,000 b/d in 2022 and 37,000 b/d next year.  US biodiesel output is forecast to decrease by 7,000 b/d this year to 100,000 b/d, and drop further next year to 86,000 b/d. Increasing feedstock prices continue to limit biodiesel production due to affordability challenges amid increased competition from the renewable diesel producers.

USAC turns to Mexico to replace Russian naphtha,13 April 2022,By Michael Connolly and Sergio Meana,"Charterer GE Warren yesterday booked a medium range (MR) tanker to carry 38,000t of naphtha on an unusual east coast Mexico-US Atlantic coast voyage, according to shipbrokers, as importers in the region look to replace Russian supplies now under sanctions.  The Hafnia Bulldog MR tanker was booked for $2.15mn lump sum to load naphtha in Pajaritos, Mexico, on 16 April and then discharge in New York. If carried out, the tanker would be just the fourth since 2016 to complete such a voyage, per Vortexa data.  So far this year, roughly 36,000 b/d of naphtha imports have flowed into the US Atlantic coast, with 77pc coming from Russia, according to Vortexa. Last year, the region imported roughly 61,000 b/d of naphtha, with 65pc coming from Russia. GE Warren's booking also included a discharge option in the US Gulf coast for $1.75mn, a slightly less unusual voyage, and one not driven by the need to replace Russian supplies. Since the start of 2021, just 5,300 b/d of naphtha imports have been shipped into the US Gulf coast, per Vortexa data. None of those imports came from Russia, while 14pc came from Mexico. Mexico through state-owned Pemex has seen its naphtha production fall this year, with February production of 27,000 b/d down by 21pc from the 34,000 b/d produced in the same month of 2021.

International air travel up at New Zealand's Auckland,14 April 2022,None,"The gradual lifting of Covid-19 restrictions boosted international traveller numbers in March at New Zealand's busiest airport of Auckland. The 117,300 international passengers that either arrived or departed Auckland in March was the highest since the 127,000 passengers in June 2021, operator Auckland Airport said. International passenger demand rose with the removal of isolation requirements for arriving New Zealanders and permanent residents. International passenger volumes were only 12pc of March 2019 but were up by 172pc on the previous month. The rise in international travellers lifted the total number of passengers travelling through the airport in March, although it was partially offset by a fall in domestic travellers as the country dealt with a wave of the Omicron variant of Covid-19.

Schnitzer to pass rising costs onto scrap suppliers,13 April 2022,By Brad MacAulay,"US metal recycler Schnitzer Steel will implement a facility fee applied to all ferrous and nonferrous materials purchased at its locations, effective 15 April, in an attempt to address rising operating costs. The facility fees will vary by geographic location because of the differing costs of compliance and requirements to meet regulatory standards throughout the country. Suppliers surveyed by Argus said that the fee schedules received from Schnitzer over the last two weeks have varied, with the facility fee for ferrous scrap heard between $5-10/gross ton (gt) with the higher end applied to suppliers on the west coast. For nonferrous, added costs were reported at 1¢/lb. In a letter to suppliers, the Portland, Oregon-based recycler said that over the last decade heightened environmental regulations have led to higher operating costs as it has invested in new equipment, emissions reduction technology and stormwater management infrastructure. Last year, Schnitzer warned that stricter regulatory requirements for hazardous waste in California could severely impact its shredding and recycling operations in the state, increase operating costs and limiting operation flexibility. Still, scrap suppliers largely have balked at the move, calling into question its effectiveness, equity and shelf life.  Schnitzer did not respond to an Argus request for comment. The added fees have market participants concerned about other large suppliers potentially taking a similar approach as costs across the supply chain have climbed over the last year. Others said new fees could prompt some suppliers with geographic options to shift sales elsewhere or invest in processing equipment to upgrade material. Schnitzer operates metal recycling facilities across 25 US states, Puerto Rico and western Canada and has seven deep water export facilities located on both the east and west coasts and in Hawaii and Puerto Rico. Schnitzer posted a $38mn profit in its fiscal second quarter ended 28 February, down from a profit of $46mn a year earlier and off from $47mn in the first quarter.","['<p class=""lead"">US metal recycler Schnitzer Steel will implement a facility fee applied to all ferrous and nonferrous materials purchased at its locations, effective 15 April, in an attempt to address rising operating costs.</p>', '<p>The facility fees will vary by geographic location because of the differing costs of compliance and requirements to meet regulatory standards throughout the country.</p>', '<p>Suppliers surveyed by <i>Argus</i> said that the fee schedules received from Schnitzer over the last two weeks have varied, with the facility fee for ferrous scrap heard between $5-10/gross ton (gt) with the higher end applied to suppliers on the west coast.

Australia’s Aemo sees renewables replacing coal plants,14 April 2022,By Kevin Morrison,"The volume of new renewable energy projects in the planning and development stage in eastern Australia should be sufficient to maintain electricity supplies following the accelerated planned closures of coal-fired plants in the region, according to the Australian Energy Market Operator (Aemo). The update of the Electricity Statement of Opportunities (ESOO), which is normally published each year around August, was done in response to plans to advance the closures of certain coal-fired plants. Australian upstream and utility firm Origin Energy plans to bring forward the planned closure of the 2,880MW Eraring coal fired plant in New South Wales (NSW) by seven years earlier than previously planned to August 2025. Utility AGL Energy is also bringing forward the planned closing dates of its two largest coal-fired plants by up to 6-8 years. There are many renewable energy projects planned in the national electricity market (NEM), which covers eastern Australia. Such projects include the NSW state government's energy roadmap that targets the construction of 12,000MW of new renewable energy capacity by 2030. Plans included in Aemo's Integrated System Plan (ISP) show that 90pc of the NEM's electricity will come from renewables by 2040.  ""If the pipeline of anticipated investments, as well as projects in the ISP and NSW government's energy roadmap, proceed to expected schedule, then forecast reliability outcomes in the NEM would meet or exceed the reliability standard in 2025-26,"" Aemo's executive general manager of system design Merryn York said. But if all of these planned projects do not proceed, there could be supply shortfalls, Aemo warned. ""The retirement of Eraring Power Station, without replacement investments, could lead to a reduction in the reliability of the NEM, particularly in NSW,"" York added. Anticipated power projects — including 1,700 MW of grid-scale wind and solar generation, along with transmission developments — will improve forecast use in NSW to within the reliability standard in the 2025-26 fiscal year to 30 June, according to Aemo. NSW's reliability will further improve following the completion of transmission projects — the Sydney Ring in July 2027 and HumeLink in 2026 — which will allow more southern NSW generation capacity — such as the 2,000MW expansion of its 4,100MW Snowy hydropower scheme in NSW, known as Snowy 2.0 — to reach Sydney, Newcastle and Wollongong during times of supply scarcity, York said.","['<p class=""lead"">The volume of new renewable energy projects in the planning and development stage in eastern Australia should be sufficient to maintain electricity supplies following the accelerated planned closures of coal-fired plants in the region, according to the Australian Energy Market Operator (Aemo).</p>', '<p>The update of the Electricity Statement of Opportunities (ESOO), which is normally published each year around August, was done in response to plans to advance the closures of certain coal-fired plants.

Fujairah suppliers offered contaminated bunker fuel,14 April 2022,By Elshan Aliyev,"Bunker suppliers in Fujairah in the UAE have been receiving offers to purchase marine fuel from vessels that bought contaminated high-sulphur fuel oil (HSFO) in Singapore.  The Maritime Authority of Singapore (MPA) was notified on 14 March that a number of ships had been supplied with HSFO containing high concentration levels of Chlorinated Organic Compounds (COC). The contaminated fuel was supplied by trading firm Glencore to Chinese bunker supplier PetroChina, which in turn supplied about 200 ships in the Port of Singapore. ""Of these, about 80 ships have reported various issues with their fuel pumps and engines,"" MPA said. A number of Fujairah bunker suppliers and traders confirmed that they have been receiving enquiries from shipping firms about the possibility of unloading, or ""de-bunkering"", the contaminated fuel. ""Last week we received three enquiries about de-bunkering in Fujairah, but hardly anyone is keen on buying it,"" a Fujairah supplier said.  ""If these vessels want to sell contaminated bunker fuel oil in the Middle East, then Fujairah is their best option as most of the other bunkering locations in the region are basically one supplier and mostly governmental companies,"" another trader said.  One source mentioned a supplier that might be interested, but this could not be confirmed. Bunker suppliers tend not to be keen on acquiring contaminated product as reblending or diluting it carries additional costs and does not necessarily ensure its safety for vessel engines.  ""We have to be very cautious because the nature of the contamination means heavy diluting may not get rid of the problem,"" a shipping source said.  Bunker fuel supplied in Singapore must meet ISO 8217 international standards. The fuel supplied by Glencore adhered to that, but ISO 8217 does not test for COC. ""It is not easy to detect COC because you need a special and very expensive test to be carried out and only three laboratories in the world can do this test,"" according to a supplier.  With around 140,000t of off-specification bunker fuel supplied, some could potentially be offered as slops or used by power utilities, according to traders.

"New Petrobras CEO, chairman confirmed by shareholders",14 April 2022,By Nathan Walters ,"Shareholders of Brazilian oil company Petrobras have approved the appointment of Jose Mauro Ferreira Coelho as the new chief executive and Marcio Andrade Weber as the new chairman, ending weeks of tension surrounding leadership at the state-controlled company. On 6 April, Ferreira Coelho was nominated by the federal government, Petrobras' controlling shareholder, just days after an initial pick, Adriano Pires, withdrew from consideration. Andrade Weber was also a replacement nominee, picked after oil industry veteran Rodolfo Landim bowed out of consideration for the chairman role.  Ferreira Coelho, a former mines and energy ministry secretary, is expected to formally assume the role later this month. His nomination was approved at a 13 April shareholder meeting almost exactly one year after the outgoing chief executive Joaquim Silva e Luna was voted into the role.  Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro fired Silva e Luna last month following an 11 March fuel price increase that incensed the country's political class. He was the second Petrobras chief executive to be fired by the populist Bolsonaro because of disagreements over fuel pricing. The market is more confident that Ferreira Coelho and Andrade Weber will keep the company wed to the import price parity principle that guides its fuel pricing policy, which strives for alignment with import prices. The company's stock has climbed steadily on the Sao Paulo stock exchange ever since news of the nominations. If Bolsonaro fails to secure a second four-year term in October elections, the executives are not likely be asked to remain in the roles by the incoming president, based on the current election landscape.","['<p class=""lead"">Shareholders of Brazilian oil company Petrobras have approved the appointment of Jose Mauro Ferreira Coelho as the new chief executive and Marcio Andrade Weber as the new chairman, ending weeks of tension surrounding leadership at the state-controlled company.</p>', ""<p>On 6 April, Ferreira Coelho was nominated by the federal government, Petrobras' controlling shareholder, just days after an initial pick, Adriano Pires, withdrew from consideration.

US ethanol stocks reach 9-week low,13 April 2022,By Thom Dwyer,"Ethanol inventories in the US decreased to their lowest level since early February while production dipped under 1mn b/d for the first time in six weeks, according to data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA). Ethanol supply levels for the week ended 8 April were reported at 24.8mn bl, down from the week before by 4.2pc. Stocks decreased everywhere except for the midcontinent where they grew by 3pc to 10.7mn bl, their highest since the week ended 25 February.  Year on year, stocks were higher by 21pc. Compared with the corresponding week of 2020, stocks were lower by 9.7pc as inventories two years ago ballooned in the face of sharply reduced fuel demand brought about by government lockdown orders meant to curb the Covid-19 pandemic. Ethanol production decreased on the week by 0.8pc to 995,000 b/d, its lowest level since the week ended 4 February when it was reported at 994,000 b/d. The midcontinent was the only region with lower production figures, falling by 1.2pc to 935,000 b/d. Production was flat to slightly higher everywhere else. Still, the latest output levels were higher by 5.7pc year on year and 75pc higher compared with the same week of 2020. Implied gasoline demand was reported at 8.7mn b/d, rising from the week before by 2pc. Compared with a year earlier, it was lower by 2.3pc. The latest demand levels were 72pc higher than two years ago.  As gasoline demand increases, the US and other countries have contended with tight road fuel supplies as the conflict in Ukraine led to sanctions on Russian crude oil and spiraling prices. On 12 April, President Joe Biden implemented the sale of gasoline blended with up to 15pc ethanol into summer months in an effort to stretch gasoline supplies. Ethanol blending tracked the higher gasoline demand and rose by 3.4pc to 887,000 b/d in the latest week, its highest since the week ended 11 March. Year on year, it was lower by 0.3pc.

Adido do USDA eleva safra de milho 2021-22 do Brasil,14 April 2022,Por João Petrini,"O adido do Departamento de Agricultura dos EUA (USDA, na sigla em inglês) no Brasil elevou sua estimativa para a safra de milho 2021-22 do país para 115 milhões de t e prevê uma produção ainda maior na temporada 2022-23, em meio ao aumento da demanda global e dos preços do grão, impulsionados pelo conflito na Ucrânia. Porém, apesar dos produtores terem espaço para expandir o plantio do milho, há incerteza em relação aos insumos, especialmente fertilizantes, o que poderia impactar a produção, aponta o adido. No relatório anterior do adido, divulgado em 4 de fevereiro, a produção de milho em 2021-22 foi estimada em 113 milhões de t, enquanto não havia estimativa para a safra seguinte. O novo relatório do adido vem alguns dias após o USDA, em seu último relatório de oferta e demanda, projetar a produção de milho do Brasil em 116 milhões de t na safra atual. O adido é um escritório regional do USDA no Brasil e seus relatórios são levados em conta pelo relatório principal do USDA. As estimativas do adido tendem a convergir com os números da sede do USDA, mas as projeções do adido muitas vezes também variam, uma vez que este tem acesso direto às informações locais. O relatório do adido é o mais recente a aumentar as estimativas de março para a safra de milho 2021-22 do Brasil. A Companhia Nacional de Abastecimento (Conab) projeta a safra de milho em 115,6 milhões de t. A estimativa do adido para a área plantada de milho foi elevada para 21,5 milhões de hectares (ha), ante 21 milhões de ha na estimativa anterior.

Q&A: Petrobras to adapt to more gas competition,14 April 2022,None,"With the new natural gas market in Brazil, state-run Petrobras is preparing to step down from its dominant position and allow for more competition. Argus talked to Alvaro Tupiassu, Petrobras´ gas and power executive manager. Edited highlights follow. When should Gaslub start to receive Rota 3 volumes of gas? Initially, what are the foreseen volumes and how should the ramp up happen? The commercial launching of the first module of the processing plant is expected to the second half of 2022, which will allow for receiving natural gas from the outflow pipeline Rota 3, that is part of the Integrated Outflow System (SIE in Portuguese) of the Santos Basin Pre-Salt. The plant has two modules with natural gas processing capacity of 10.5mn m³/d of each. The second module is expected to start operating in the first half of 2023. Are Gaslub and the related infrastructure ready to receive this gas? At the launching of the plant, all necessary equipment will allow for the plant to operate in its maximum capacity, receiving all the gas from the Rota 3 pipeline. Is Petrobras prepared to sign third-party gas processing contracts at Gaslub? Is anything needed for this to happen? On 23 December, Petrobras signed the first processing contracts for access to the Gaslub processing plant. It is still in talks with the other producers of the Santos Basin Pre-Salt Pole interested in accessing this unit and the other plants connected to the Integrated Outflow System, namely Gas Treatment Units in Cabiúnas (RJ) and Caraguatatuba (SP). Route 3 gas is a rich gas, with a lot of natural gas liquids (NGLs). What can be done with the NGLs? Does Petrobras intend to buy it? Access to natural gas processing plants is carried out through an operation called ""industrialization on demand"". This consists of sending gas for processing by the owner of the UPGN and returning natural gas and liquid derivatives back, with the producer maintaining ownership of these products throughout the process. In this sense, each producer that hires processing capacity must arrange for the timely removal of the derivatives owned directly or by a third party. Can Petrobras invest in natural gas liquefaction in the future, given the high prices in the international market for this commodity? Petrobras does not foresee investments in liquefaction projects within the horizon of the Strategic Plan 2022-2026. Petrobras started processing natural gas for third parties. Is this a line of business that interests Petrobras, or is it ideal for the company to divest from UPGNs, as was the case with gas pipelines and refineries? Processing plants and natural gas pipelines are infrastructure developed to enable the production of natural gas from the hubs for which they were originally designed. Within the scope of its portfolio management, Petrobras continuously evaluates the divestment and investment alternatives, in order to maximize the results for its shareholders according to its strategic plan. In this context, in the case of production assets located in the northeast region, Petrobras included in the divestment processes the natural gas flow and processing infrastructure integrated with such assets. What is the direction for the natural gas market in Brazil, in Petrobras' point of view? What needs to be expanded, what does Petrobras want to invest in? With the advancement of the legal and regulatory framework, we expect an increasingly open and competitive market. Considering this movement, our business strategies reflect this adaptation and transformation effort. To ensure our future and to continue investing, we will continue to be a financially healthy, more efficient and more competitive company. In this sense, our strategy for natural gas consists of operating competitively in the sale of our own gas and optimizing the thermoelectric portfolio with a focus on self-consumption.","['<p class=""lead""><i>With the new natural gas market in Brazil, state-run Petrobras is preparing to step down from its dominant position and allow for more competition.

ArcelorMittal buys 80pc of Texas HBI plant,14 April 2022,By Rye Druzin,"Global steelmaker ArcelorMittal plans to acquire an 80pc stake in Voestalpine's hot briquetted iron (HBI) plant in Corpus Christi, Texas.  ArcelorMittal will spend approximately $680mn to buy the 80pc stake from Austria-based Voestalpine, with the value of the facility listed at $1bn, Voestalpine said. The deal is expected to close in the next two to three months. The purchase of the majority stake in the 2mn metric tonnes/yr HBI plant on the Texas Gulf coast comes just days after the Austrian steelmaker announced it would be selling the stake in the facility.  As a part of the deal, Voestalpine signed a long-term agreement with ArcelorMittal for production equaling its 20pc stake, or 420,000 t/yr of HBI, for its steel mills in Austria. The remaining 1.6mn t/yr of production will be delivered to third parties under existing supply contracts and eventually to ArcelorMittal's joint venture ArcelorMittal/Nippon Steel (AM/NS) Calvert flat-rolled mill in Alabama. A new 1.5mn t/yr electric arc furnace (EAF) being built there will be partially fed with HBI from Texas.  The EAF, located north of Mobile, Alabama, is expected to be commissioned in the second half of 2023, and is accessible via barge from the Corpus Christi HBI facility. The Corpus Christi plant exported 506,000t in 2021, and 1.1mn t in 2020, according to US Commerce Department data. Austria received 105,000t in 2021 and 99,000t in 2020 from the plant. ArcelorMittal also said the Texas HBI plant, which opened in 2016, could be switched from natural gas to renewable energy-based hydrogen in the future. In Canada, ArcelorMittal is converting its Dofasco integrated steel mill into a 2.4mn t/yr EAF and building a new 2mn t/yr direct reduced iron (DRI) plant on-site to supply raw material to the mill. Both are expected to be operational by 2028.","['<p class=""lead"">Global steelmaker ArcelorMittal plans to acquire an 80pc stake in Voestalpine\'s hot briquetted iron (HBI) plant in Corpus Christi, Texas. </p>', '<p>ArcelorMittal will spend approximately $680mn to buy the 80pc stake from Austria-based Voestalpine, with the value of the facility listed at $1bn, Voestalpine said.</p>', '<p>The deal is expected to close in the next two to three months.</p>', '<p>The purchase of the majority stake in the 2mn metric tonnes/yr HBI plant on the Texas Gulf coast comes just days after the Austrian steelmaker <a href=""https://www.argusmedia.com/metals-platform/newsandanalysis/article/2320911-Voestalpine-to-sell-stake-in-US-HBI-plant"">announced it would be selling the stake in the facility</a>. </p>', '<p>As a part of the deal, Voestalpine signed a long-term agreement with ArcelorMittal for production equaling its 20pc stake, or 420,000 t/yr of HBI, for its steel mills in Austria.</p>', ""<p>The remaining 1.6mn t/yr of production will be delivered to third parties under existing supply contracts and eventually to ArcelorMittal's joint venture ArcelorMittal/Nippon Steel (AM/NS) Calvert flat-rolled mill in Alabama.

Uncertain future for record European Al premiums,14 April 2022,By Jethro Wookey,"Aluminium prices have fallen back from record highs over the past month while European premiums have continued to climb on tight supply levels and strong, pent-up demand. But changing supply dynamics will test the robustness of this demand throughout the rest of this year. London Metal Exchange (LME) aluminium prices have trended downwards over the past few weeks. The three-month aluminium contract has fallen by almost 12pc from the recent high on 24 March, settling at $3,238 on 13 April. Prices have been volatile since reaching record highs of $3,967/t on 7 March, but have now fallen back to their lowest level since mid February, before the start of the Russia-Ukraine conflict that has led to supply fears across a number of metals and energy markets. But premiums in Europe have continued to climb against a tight supply picture. The Argus weekly assessment for the duty-paid P1020 in-warehouse Rotterdam premium midpoint reached $585/t on 13 March, up by $100/t since 7 March, when LME prices reached record highs before falling back. Premiums have continued to climb because of severe supply tightness in Europe so far this year, after punishingly high energy prices forced a number of capacity curtailments. Strong demand across a number of sectors as economies moved into the post-Covid-19 lockdown era has seen offer prices rise swiftly in such an environment. But there is uncertainty over whether this demand can sustain those premiums in the coming months. High premiums have attracted metal from international markets, particularly into southern Europe, which presents a cheaper shipping option, and has traded at a premium to Rotterdam this year. Aluminium billet trading companies have noted fresh offers in recent weeks from suppliers in Turkey, South Korea and Malaysia, while the spectre of Chinese metal has reappeared after the country turned net exporter again in the first quarter for the first time since late 2019. China began importing huge volumes of aluminium in the early stages of the pandemic after demand plummeted in other regions during the first lockdowns, and its new status as a net importer of aluminium was sustained over the following two years on high infrastructure investment in China. China imported a record 3.2mn t of unwrought aluminium and products in 2021 and 2.7mn t in 2020. But Chinese imports have slumped this year and export levels are rising. January's imports totalled 57,000t, from 245,000t in January last year and from 244,000t in December, and fell further to just over 18,000t in February. With millions of people still under full or partial lockdown in China after a recent surge in Covid-19 infections, more Chinese metal could be bound for export and into hungry European markets. Aluminium prices in China have also fallen back in recent weeks. Shanghai Futures Exchange aluminium prices reached 21,290.03 yuan/t on 13 March, down by 8.11pc from the recent highs on 24 March. Should sufficient metal be attracted into European markets, premiums could start to trend downwards, and considering that premiums are at record highs, the downside could be considerable. But while demand is the most important current driver, there are a number of other factors that will continue to apply upwards pressure to regional premiums even in the event of significantly higher imports. The Russia-Ukraine conflict continues to cast a heavy shadow over European markets, which are significantly exposed to falling supplies of Russian metal and energy. Transportation is still difficult, and costs remain high across logistical chains. The aluminium market as a whole has moved to a structurally higher price environment. Illustrating this, aluminium billet consumers have reported premium offers from major suppliers for third-quarter deliveries similar to current premium levels, which have settled at record highs this year. This is despite significant deliveries of international billets to European destinations so far in 2022.","['<p class=""lead"">Aluminium prices have fallen back from record highs over the past month while European premiums have continued to climb on tight supply levels and strong, pent-up demand.
